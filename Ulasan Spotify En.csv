"Starting in December, the app started crashing when used in the background. I've triple-checked settings. It's 100% the app's issue. This is a big problem, because listening in the background is the whole point? To listen to music? I'm not going to be staring at the app the whole time. It's so frustrating. I'm now using YouTube Music more. Scrolling functionality is weird now. They also changed the heart/like icon to a plus sign? It's not intuitive and is weird. I updated the app. Same issues.",2
"I've loved this app for many years. Lately, however, songs in my playlists will switch places; specifically, a song from the middle, and the first song. The bulk of my playlists are in a specific order (an artist's complete chronological discography, usually), so this presents a significant issue. Furthermore, many of the playlists integrate songs from my phone, so remaking the playlist would be a major hassle. I hope that this issue will be rectified soon.",3
"Spotify is my favorite music streaming app by a landslide, and I'm on the iPhone app pretty much 24/7, but the Chrome version still needs some work. It's clunky, and it pretty reliably crashes or freezes. In fact, I just downloaded the updated version hoping it would have improved upon this problem, and the app opened - to a nicer interface - and then crashed inside of ~30 seconds. Hoping to see improvements in the future, but in the meantime, I'll be mostly hanging out on my iPhone app.",3
"It's really annoying when the music doesn't have lyrics and like 70% of the time the lyrics aren't there. For the free users, there too many ads and you can't even play it in shuffle order. The only thing I like about this app is that there's a lot of good playlists already there and there are great podcasts and it has pretty good song recommendation.",2
"Great library, generally easy to use. Negatives: Search feature sometimes just doesn't work. I'm connected to wifi, but it will hang for 5 minutes plus without giving any results. Just the loading circle. UX with using it in airplane mode is also really poor, even in offline mode sometimes it just won't play downloaded songs. Still better than YouTube music.",2
"I like the app overall and the choice of music is excellent. I also like the fact it has a free tier and am happy to accept it is supported by advertising. What I don't like is that the adverts are turned up SO LOUD it feels as if they're trying to torture me into buying a product I probably have no interest in. I'm not deaf (yet), play the advert the same volume as I have my music set, if I can hear that, I can hear your advert. I'll listen again when you fix this.",2
"Please bring back the Enhance feature! Using Enhance, I could build massive playlists starting with only a few songs. It was amazing for music discovery, one of the main reasons I use Spotify. There was absolutely no reason to remove that entirely unobtrusive feature, and nothing else Spotify offers is comparable. I could easily see which songs were suggested and quickly add the ones I liked. Giving a kid candy and then taking it away is just mean. I've had premium for years. How disappointing.",1
"I used to love this app but the smart shuffle completely ruins my listening experience and I can't turn it off. It means that when I want to listen to a specific playlist or album, the app will start playing whatever it thinks I want to hear - except what I try to listen to. If I click on an album, I obviously want to listen to THAT album. If they were to play similar music after that playlist is over, that's fine. But it starts immediately. Not tempted to go back to premium.",1
"After many years of happily using the Spotify mobile app on several Android phones, within the past few months, it's become non-functional. The home screen MIGHT load, and if I can get a second screen to load (which is rarely if ever), it can't play a song. Even if my phone and desktop are on the same wi-fi, the mobile app does not recognize the second device and I can't switch between them. No matter how many times I uninstall and reinstall the app, this has only gotten worse. Please fix ASAP.",1
"Literally the only thing I want to do is shuffle songs, and it won't. IT plays the most recently added songs in the order I added them, no matter what I do. I've restarted the app, restarted my phone, deleted and re downloaded the app, I'm sitting here clearing out the queue song by song and they just pop right back up again. Shuffling songs is the most basic feature of a music app, absolutely ridiculous. I have had nothing but problems since I started using Spoify. I'm going back to YT music.",1
"The local files function is completely broken since I updated. Some tracks are completely gone, others are gone from playlists but show up under ""local files"" but with all the spaces removed from the titles, some have duplicates but with different titles. For years the local files function worked great for me, but for the last year or two it has just gotten worse and worse, lately it barely works at all. It's incredibly disappointing.",1
"I love this app, I really do, as I've been using it for years...but lately the app isn't working like it used to. It will not let me add anymore songs, (I have less than 2000 and there's supposed to be unlimited), to any playlist. Everyday I have to search for songs and podcasts I tried saving to a list. I pay for premium and I can't even listen to downloaded music offline which is a feature of premium service. It won't even download. Please fix these issues, because reinstalling doesn't help.",2
"I wish I could give it a 5 but the longer you use the app the more often it feels like adds play if you don't have premium. It's a bit frustrating not being able to listen to a singular song, but I do like that it gives a playlist based on the song. I usually don't like the songs it shows, but every now and then I'll hear a good one. The app also glitches now and then, not playing or just not showing up on the lock screen. Premium is totally worth it though, cost and all. 6/5 with premium.",4
"Spotify is a great app. I have been a premium user for several years now and have had a great overall experience. With the notable exception of the last month. The app has been consistently breaking, not connecting to the internet. As a premium user, I think, ""Well, that's okay, I download all my music for a reason."" But that doesn't even remotely matter when the app is still CONSTANTLY loading, even in offline mode, as if it were trying to connect to the weakest of weak signals. Fix this.",2
"Listening to the specific song you want to listen to is virtually impossible without premium. You'll click one song, and another will pop up as a ""recommended song"". When I click on a song, I want to listen to that song, not something like it! The app is basically useless for anyone trying to listen to songs their friends sent. Looking up the songs on YouTube will have better results.",2
"I enjoy this app. I use Spotify on my phone and laptop. Recently, the app on my phone has decided to switch songs around. It usually is the first song and some other song, usually in the middle of the playlist. I cannot move songs around on my phone and the app on the computer shows that everything is in its place. It sucks that I cannot listen, for example, the entirety of the LOTR songs in order because the prologue is in the middle. I hope it gets fixed soon.",3
"Good when it let's you listen to the music you choose. It's sticky sometimes, I would have to close and reopen the app just to play my song, and after it plays the songs on your playlist it makes you listen to ""suggested songs"" for at least a week (if you want to listen to the playlist). I'm sorry but there should be a separate feature for suggested songs because if I'm on my day to day commute I want to listen to the music I picked. Most of the time it doesn't give me trouble though.",3
"As much as I have loved this app for the past 6+ years, there have been some glaring issues within the app that have not been fixed for way too long. Smart Shuffle is one of them for me. While it is an objectively better version of Enhancing your playlists because it adds songs that are actually related to your playlist, the shuffle part of Smart Shuffle does not work at all. Every time I Smart Shuffle my playlist, it plays the same songs in the same order, without fail. I hope this get's fixed.",3
"I have been a premium user for a while. The video podcasts either do not show the ""play video"" option, or the video does not play. Everytime I open Spotify, I have to close and open it again because it hangs, especially after a call, when it doesn't continue the playlist. I have to omit a song or artist from one playlist at a time instead of throughout the app. Also can't omit albums or playlists from my taste entirely, just one song at a time in a playlist.",2
"It feels like every update makes the app worse. The added random tiktok version song button on the album is completely useless to me (who would use this when they're already on the album instead of just playing a song.) So I would just ignore this button, but every time you go on a album the button animates which is really annoying when you're never going to use it. I just hope they give you the option to disable the button, or at least the animation.",1
"I think the app needs an update. It takes a couple minutes to launch, even in offline mode. I'm experiencing some really bad lag. Update: Now the app won't launch at all. This is a little frustrating because I can't listen to any music or podcasts until these crashes are fixed. Newest update: Uninstalling and reinstalling seemed to work. Still seems like a patch is needed though.",4
"With the issues Spotify has, it's beginning to feel too expensive. I download all the albums I like and usually keep it in offline mode. If I power off my phone, while Spotify is in offline mode, it says ""There was a problem"" or something like that, and I cannot get back into Spotify without reinstalling. As a result I have to redownload all the albums again which is very annoying. Offline mode needs some attention, it goofs up often and I need to download everything again.",3
"Great if you have Premium. After no longer being able to afford it, you really see the bugs. Especially if using another device to play from. Ads constantly ""play"" but takes you pausing it and replaying the ad for it to go through the other devices (both are updated) sometimes 2 to 3 times. The normal 2 ads have multiple to 4-5 sometimes because of this. I shouldn't have to pause my ads to replay them for this app to continue playing music.",2
"I can't remember a time when this app didn't have at least one issue. Incredibly unreliable. Each update fixes something but breaks something else. Currently, I can't open the app without it crashing. Even going to my settings to force stop the app doesn't fix it. I hate that spotify has better music quality and a more intuitive layout than YouTube music. If only the rest of the app could FUNCTION. Spotify, you literally have one job. A music app that works. FIX THIS!",1
"You pretty much have to pay for everything, just for it to work right. You cannot play the song you press on without paying, you cant skip more than 6 songs and hour without paying, and overall, it doesn't work without paying for everything even though it's a free app. I'd definitely recommend something else to use to listen to music. Edit: Oh, and I only get 4 song skips when it says 6. And ads STILL will keep playing after it says I get 30 minutes of free ads.",2
"App has reached a point where the removal or redesign of features that haven't caused any issues have plagued the app. You can't simply like a song anymore without opening a window with all of your playlists and you can't tell you don't have a song liked if it's in one of your playlists (the checkmark icon). You can't add or remove playlists to your profile without making them private? No clue why a lot of the changes that have been made to this app were approved, please fix it.",3
I really enjoy everything that is offered within the service and app. However I'm having problems with the app not responding at random times of the day. I usually have to restart my phone every morning and again later in the day if I have to pause something and come back later. Force closing or stopping the app does not work. It requires a phone restart. Any progress on this bug/ fix? Google Pixel 8 Pro.,3
"I want to like this app but it will not work. Playback is continuously stopping, usually after an advertisement, sometimes after a song. The counter continues to go up as if the song or advertisement are still playing but the only way to get the music to start again is to completely close and re open the app. And then I have to start the Playlist all over. Infuriating. Tried reinstalling- doesn't work. Customer service is no help.",2
"Attempting to listen to an album is an exercise in frustration on a free account. The track list is set to shuffle with no way to disable, ""suggested"" songs are inserted after every three tracks, and ads are just as frequent despite an alert popping up advising that the next 30 minutes will be ad-free. It's good app if you want to be fed a stream of music like Pandora does, but unless you're paying, there's no way to truly curate your own listening experience.",1
"Spotify has been ridiculous since the recent updates. It seems way too concerned with forcing an algorithm and playing music you don't like. Every time I open the app it starts playing a random track from a random artist that, often, I've never heard of. No setting to disable that. Also, ""smart shuffle"" is a really dumb idea and despite an overwhelmingly negative reception of this feature, there is no setting to permanently disable. The app is also just seeming very bugged and glitchy lately.",1
"I'm editing my review because a couple reinstalls did fix offline mode, but navigation has become difficult in this app in general, and it's very difficult to add the same song more than once to a playlist. My playlists randomly unsort themselves. The algorithm kinda keeps me trapped in the same groups of music and makes it hard to search for new music, I wish it could switch off. Enhance shuffle will also randomly turn on after turning it off. I like discover weekly because it's not intrusive.",3
"EDIT: Uninstall/Reinstall fixed the issue. But, as mentioned, this is a recurring issue. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Been having trouble playing certain podcasts sporadically the last 6 months or so. App is up-to-date. Tried closing and reopening app. I've contacted Spotify support in the past via chat and they say log out/in, reinstall, etc. It's kind of ridiculous this happens again and again. I don't get it...",3
"Editing on 1/28/24. I don't know what happened, but my playlists are getting messed up. I have the set up in a specific manner, and the first song is bumped down somewhere else into my playlist and replaced by a completely different song in the playlist. This isn't happening on my desktop version, and it's getting rather annoying trying to fix this issue.",2
"Good music and podcast selection, BUT. The devices override each other and this Is a major problem. You can not stream from one spotify account on 2 separate devices simultaneously. (For instance if I'm driving in my car and using my phone and a family member at home uses a home device). Additionally, once the secondary device is activated, it overrides the phone even if spotify is not in use!! This is a major issue that should be fixed.",2
"The ads for the free version have become ridiculous. They are literally everywhere. You change your music selection? Ad. Scrolling through the playlists for music? Ad. Not to mention there are literally ads at the bottom of the screen when you're looking at what song you're listening to. Sometimes you get ads not even 30 minutes into your music session. Plus, the cost for premium has gone up; and it's not like they added any new features.",1
"I'm in love this app and have used it for multiple years, but lately I've been having issues with it: - The first songs of a playlist randomly changing place and replacing each other, without me even trying to do so, and if I attempt to fix this, it'll ignore any changes I do. - No longer having the ability to list playlists on my profile; the button for it disappeared completely and I have no way to do this unless I go on desktop, which is rather inconvenient. Please fix these bugs asap 🙏",4
"In one of the playlists that I made and use everyday, all of a sudden it's adding one of the songs from the middle of the playlist and putting it at the top of the list. However on my laptop everything is fine, but on my phone app there's this weird glitch. I tried clearing cache and restarting the app but still no resolution. When I try dragging the song back to the middle where it belongs, it just messes up the order of the other songs.",1
"The addition of smart shuffle has been awful. Switching between shuffle on and off has become buggy, requiring repeated turning off and on for it to stay off when switching between songs. When you want to stop shuffling at one song so you can go to the next in the playlist, it resets to the first song in the playlist, rather than where you were at. It's unintuitive, annoying, and buggy. This feature alone makes me want to switch entirely to SoundCloud.",2
I loved Spotify at first. But it started irritating me where the premium adds started to come. 1. I can't move the song forward or Backward. 2. I can't play songs on order in my playlist. 3. I can't even sometimes see the lyrics of the song. 4. You get adds twice a song. All over to say.. I should have given this app a 1star. But I still don't hate it. I know they do it cuz they want money. But you can't take our choice of songs. Pls lower the disadvantages of non - premium.,3
"Experiencing a number of issues the past few weeks. Curated playlists in specific track orders are now jumbled and if edited are altered again on saving. Since yesterday, playlists and albums are no longer playing in correct order. For example, played Led Zeppelin II, first track, but then jumped to a 2010s dance track. Service is almost unusable for the purpose I use it. No tracks are queued and have attempted all recommended fixes including reinstall, but still no improvement.",2
"Great app overall. Needs a few improvements..sometimes when playing music, I'll open another app and Spotify stops. Usually this happens once a day and that's it. Like open Waze or Google Maps I really notice it. Second, the lyrics page on app and desktop chooses a color from album art. Spotify serves up red as the background color often and it's blindingly bad, even worse on the desktop. I prefer just setting my own background color and be done with it.",4
Every time I try to turn off smart shuffle and I have something in queue it skips forward. Please just let it be an option in settings to turn it off completely. Also I'd like if the DJ didn't have sets completely unrelated to my music taste. There's been some crashes and audio problems too lately. My music will often change volumes a couple times. Other than this I love Spotify and recommend it highly.,1
"I did a bit of research and after 2 or 3 songs, 4 to 6 ads will play. ranging each about 30 seconds, there is an equal amount of ad to video. I think I'd rather just download every song and play it myself, because I'll still save copious amounts of time hearing about stuff I don't care about whatsoever. the premium plans are despicable, and the ads on the homepage while navigating to where you want to be are unbearable too. just put the extra effort in and grab some playlists to download.",1
Like the app. Love the fact that it has a sleep timer so that I can listen to a podcast and then have it turn off while I'm asleep. Wish you could just block explicit songs and NOT podcasts like you can with Amazon music... Would prefer not too have to keep toggling the button each time I want to switch between podcasts and music like I can with Amazon Music. Will be using that while I've got Prime. Developer did not read review properly.,3
"I would love to give a higher rating, but I seemingly have to uninstall and reinstall every month because of a random glitch for the past few months. This time it was that my podcast (JRE) stopped in the middle of an episode and when I went to hit play there was only ONE episode visible? Any other listener knows that's far from correct. Last month I'd hit play and it would just be ""loading"" eternally. Before that, it kept just randomly stopping without any prompt to do so. Always something.",3
"I love Spotify, but this new update makes the app almost unusable. Now, after this new update, I can't just go into my Playlists and pick any song. I have to listen to the whole playlist to get to one song. And, you guys started adding songs to my playlists that I dont even like. Also, now I can't skip to a certain spot in a song. It's ridiculous and frustrating. Please change that. I'll update my review after you guys fix that. If not, I'll just switch back to YouTube music or pandora.",1
"The only monthly subscription I have that I absolutely cannot live without. I will forever be a loyal listener. ***EDIT*** Only works roughly half the time on Android. Can rarely open Spotify links sent by others, Smart Shuffle turns on automatically even after I turn it off. Seems to work fine on Apple and PC. Seems Spotify isn't concerned with their Android users. For the first time ever, I'm seriously considering another music streaming service.",2
Its an okay app. I use it for my music all the time there is only one problem with it. When ever I've been listening to music and stuff and I'll pause my playlist close the app or even if i just pause it after a while or maybe the next time I'm wanting to listen to music it goes back to whatever song i listened to first the last time and continues to play the same songs. I genuinely haven't been able to listen to the rest of my playlists in ages and its so irritating.,2
"App has become unstable af. Barely loads half the time, it's just music ffs. And it's become so bloated with all of the extra stuff, podcasts, audiobooks etc. With no options to turn that media off. No customization of your home screen, it's all what they want you to see. It's impossible to find what you want easily. The shuffle is fake, you'll hear the same 20 songs from your playlist of 10000. The app from 5 years ago was miles better than what it is now.",2
"Congrats!! Thanks to the option of atleast giving 1 star or u would prefer giving 0. I mean ads and all are fine but what's the case with can't play songs on loop, can't go back to a song, can't choose shuffle in the correct order, can't navigate through the songs. And above all...I can't even skip more than 6 songs per hour. Spotify mixes two polar genres and now I can't even skip. Amazing!!",1
"Whatever this latest update did, the app runs like garbage. Downloading tracks for offline has been and is now even more of a crapshoot. The main page takes *at least* 2 minutes to load. The main page, every album, and every artist page has a 50/50 chance of crashing the app, online or offline. The app says I'm offline even just after having the app open on wifi. This app has been degrading recently, and nothing has changed on my side. 🤷‍♂️",1
"Premium user here! Lately I've been having a problem logging in on my other device. It keeps telling me that I don't have any internet connection although I have. I've tried every fix that I found on google but nothing worked. I even tried installing older versions of spotify but no luck. And this bug seems to go on for years for other users. It would suck to discover one day that I can't access my account at all, not even to cancel my subscription. Then this would turn into a legal matter.",2
"I've been using spotify for over 10 years now. I'm officially at the end of my rope.The app continually gets worse. If you use the app in offline mode, it usually doesn't work. It freezes up and crashes. Even online, it crashes pretty regularly. When they added the ability to sort music by genre, it worked for the most part. Now, somehow, Sade is in the same genre as Neil Francis. Tell me how works. It makes it impossible to sort and find a lot of music. Can't wait to listen to Neil Young again",1
"It has many music and playlists dedicated to your search. however, after only one song it plays about 3 or 6 ads (without premium) and it gets very frustrating. It makes the app unenjoyable if you don't pay. It adds random songs to your playlists even if you didn't add them as well. And I've heard many stories how people still have problems even with premium. Getting a different music app is probably better if you want a good listening experience.",2
"I'm about done with spotify. I understand that if I don't buy the premium membership I have to listen to commercials. They are a business and need revenue to operate. But after two or three songs I get 3-4 long commercials I can't skip after getting the basic info, I can't help but think why not go back to my radio or other apps. Spotify is not worth it if you don't get premium. I'll go back to other apps and my radio. But I will say, podcast side I'm good with, just not the music side.",2
"I loved spotify. It was the best thing ever for me. I could make Playlists, shuffle for a while, a d the. They decided to update it and everything turned into a worse version of IHeart radio. If I look up a song, I can no longer play the song I want, I have to listen to a station of the song. I can't get rid of the added songs on my Playlist anymore, which irritates me bc my Playlist are for very specific moods or characters. It used to be a good app. The best even. But they ruined it.",2
"When Spotify actually works it's fantastic. But every time I go on Spotify I've got to wait 5 - 10 mins for it to work because it says I either don't have a WiFi connection or "" Spotify is currently set to offline"". And if you have to uninstall then reinstall the app, you'll lose everything you've downloaded and if you're anything like me and download like 80GB of music, then you know how long that takes to redo. If I continue to have problems with this app, I'll just cancel my subscription.",3
"I have turned off autoplay, car play, I have turned off every setting that might autoplay anything. And yet, everytime I open the app with it connected to Bluetooth, it starts playing something, sometimes not even anything I would ever listen to. So frustrating. When I switch between headphones to car stereo, it will sometimes go back to playing the last thing I was playing in the car. Even if I close the app, connecting to any Bluetooth device will make the app turn on and autoplay.",1
"Yk this used to be such a good app? I've been using it since 2018, and it isn't intil recently that i started having isues with it. One, the add to music ratio is insane. I listen to TWO songs and then get a whole minute of adds. And on top of that, it doesn't even play from albums anymore. I click on an album i want to listen to and it decides to play some random song. I'm going to switch to Soundcloud permanently if this keeps up.",1
"The single star is for a solid library of music choice, including an incredible selection of video game music. This app lacks basic features it's astonishing it's an industry leader. No voice search? When my wife searches a song and plays it, it plays that song only on repeat. When I search it, it starts a Playlist of similar music. Why is it inconsistent? It sometimes sees my galaxy fold as a tablet and won't allow car mode, other times it's fine. Did I mention NO VOICE SEARCH?! Ridiculous.",2
"3rd Feb: Very pleased to report that the issue below was responded to and remedied. Playlist function now behaves as expected. ------ Playlist function is screwed. When I add a new track and reorder it's position, a random song from the middle of the list moves by itself to first in the list. A pain in the backside when the playlist is intended to be chronological. What the hell are the developers playing at?",4
"Pretty cool. I am very pleased with the recommendations that Spotify offers. Thanks to that, I've discovered many amazing songs and podcasts. The only downside is the lack of ""stats,"" meaning you are not able to check your top song, genres, etc. (Besides Wrapped). Just a side note: after the last update, songs in my playlists randomly change places with others. It's really frustrating. I hope the devs can fix it soon.",4
"I dont want to notice updates to this app, just play my music! Smart shuffle is so annoying, I have to click the button five or six times to turn normal shuffle on and off with all the lag from removing and adding the smart recommendations, and Ive not used it once. Constantly changing the system for liked songs is also irritating, it was fine 6,7 years ago, leave it alone! Better algorithmic suggestions are awesome but make new places for them, dont mess up tried and true systems.",3
"When it works, it's great. But it constantly disconnects when playing over Bluetooth, or just won't open at all. Sometimes, it does this fun thing where it decides it's going to skip over what I'm listening to and just start playing something random, and it won't let me go back to what I was originally playing. I have to restart my phone just to get it to work again. So great, especially when I'm driving!",2
"Spotify has never been perfect, but recently it seems to have amassed a load of bugs. One that had been driving me crazy is car mode. Whenever my phone connects to my car, shuffle turns off and it only plays one artist's music. It's also clear certain artists are prioritised in shuffle. I added 1 song of a mainstream artist to my biggest Playlist and now every time I listen to Spotify, boom, that songs ready to play. Making for a really bad experience for what seems so simple",1
"The ""Spotify Connect"" has been the bane of my existence. Please remove it or allow the feature to be turned off. This feature"" is more of a hindrance and intrusive than any app I've seen to date. This feature automatically turns on Spotify whenever I turn off Netflix or Youtube or when I take my headphones off my ear (my when my headset comes off). I listen to videos a lot with my headphones across multiple apps and when spotify starts playing I get enraged. Close to deleting.",1
"Great app. I have premium but when I didn't I found the ads to be very annoying. I don't know if this is a new update but my playlists would malfunction and remove songs or mix up the songs in different orders then I put them in. It would put random songs at the top and put the top song somewhere else or remove it completely from the playlist. The glitch/update is very confusing for when I am trying to edit my playlists, but other then that the quality is good, it is easy to use and simple.",2
"I've been a Spotify premium subscriber for over 6 years, and I love the service, but the user interface has gotten so bad over the years that I'm thinking of switching to Amazon music. You can't find anything, ever, it is so congested with content with no order whatsoever. You can never find Discover Weekly or queue up a playlist, and now they changed the method for liking songs. They overcomplicated it when it could be simple, seamless, and minimal. What are you guys doing over there, Spotify?",2
"I'm not really sure what's going on, but several times per month, the app will not play on any of my devices. I have several Alexa speakers (Studio, Echo, Show) and a Denon home theatre system. My Wi-Fi will be working great, I will have restarted my phone, updated and restarted all apps, rebooted my Deco mesh system, but still, the device list will be empty except for a random Firestick from somewhere in the house. Why??? Then magically in a few hours, they all come back.",2
"I was always a Spotify fan and still kinda am if it would load! When it does load I'm lucky if I can get a couple songs in before it crashes. If the stability of the app was fixed id give it a 5. I like the new layout. With the info about artists, the scrolling lyrics and stuff. I had an older version for years and it never crashed. Even though I like the new stuff I'd gladly go back to the old version because it's all about the music!!!",3
"It was AMAZING untill the new update. It adds songs to my playlist that i dont even want, plus it doesn't allow me to switch songs throughout my playlist, what a downgrade. I would heavily appreciate if y'all could bring back old spotify. Many individuals, including me, have complained and even stopped using the app due to this update. I would also appreciate for there to be hour long loops. i have Aspergers and ADHD, and sometimes to help deal with stress i like to listen to music for hours.",1
"Ok, so first of all. I love Spotify. The music performance is great! I like how you can choose how many seconds are in the sing fade. But, Ofc it has it's problems. When i check my playlists, it automatically takes the first song and puts in the middle. I also don't know if it's my phone or my Spotify, bc the short videos with the songs don't play anymore. I just stays frozen. It happened after Taylor Swift was #1 and the dot on the playing bar was glowing.",4
"As stated in a previous review, I hate that it auto connects to Bluetooth. I have small children and connect to speakers to play music for them. I am getting rid of premium and deleting the app until this can be fixed. I looked online and this has been a problem for at least 5 years. Unacceptable in my opinion. I turned off all permissions and the background data and it still plays. Probably will never get this service again.",1
"I understand this app yet I don't. Even though I had downloaded a bunch of songs, whenever I open up playlists full of my downloaded songs it still shows me the loading screen which would stay for about 3 mins and ""Try again"" would pop up after. It's frustrating especially when I'm someone who would play music the whole day and this has been what I'm doing for the past year. Please fix it.",1
"Recently hopped onto Spotify, mainly I'm a PC user, and gotta say, it's pretty perfect there. Trying out the mobile version, and it's not bad either. However, encountered a issue/problem with my liked songs – they play random parts, seriously frustrating. Can't enjoy what I've liked, and that's a bit of a downer. Never had this issue on SoundCloud, where I spent many days. Hoping the Spotify team can sort this out in the next update. Thanks for addressing these concerns!",1
Was great until about a week ago. Playlists I worked so hard on now have songs added that I didn't add. And I can't edit some playlists either. It's very frustrating when you look for answers and they don't help the issue. I don't understand why random songs are added to my created playlist that I don't want in that order. This is my last month as a subscription member. This is insane,1
"Been using the app for years, but recently my biggest problem has been this: I have a playlist that has over 200 songs in it and for some reason, it now only plays like 50 of those songs over and over and no matter how many times I skip the song it plays it again like 5 minutes later! Yes I like the song but there's loads of other songs in the playlist that I really wanna hear too! I hope someone will understand what I'm trying to say. Hopefully this will be fixed soon...",3
"This app keeps crashing in me since a few days. I haven't been able to open it for a few days and it looks like I'll have to try and reinstall and lose all my downloaded. Really annoying. And even before that, listening to downloaded music when I've got no reception is a pita with excruciatingly long wait times until the app remembers that there is something downloaded, actually.",1
"Bug: one song every play session does not keeps playing without sound. Sound returns for the next track, or if I rewind the current one to the beginning. Have cleared storage, cache and reinstalled to no avail. Library management is better but nowhere near good enough to let me enjoy millions of songs in the catalog or in my library. Seems deliberate. Hindi songs depend significantly on the quality of lyrics but the algorithm doesn't account for that.",3
"Don't install. I had been listening to music on Spotify for 2 years before this but now I am about to uninstall it. I am also a person who suggested Spotify to many. I loved Spotify before. And now I've been started to get irritated by this app. Adds are fine, but not able to repeat same song and not able to move song backward and forward is to very very bad experience for those who love music, and nothing less than a emotional pain for those who listen songs on Spotify for almost entire a day.",1
"Longtime premium subscriber. This app has gotten so buggy. Podcasts won't play, won't track progress, or will freeze randomly. Car mode is annoying. Songs glitch and mislabel on my Playlists so the song playing is not the song I selected to play. What the heck happened? App used to run smoothly. I'm seriously considering switching to another music streaming service.",1
"What happened, Spotify? The app is not working properly anymore. My playlist tracks are now randomly rearranged without me moving them. When I tried to move tracks in the order, I like it automatically moves tracks to the top of the playlist I don't want there. I can't edit my playlist and rearrange my tracks like I used to. Fix the bugs in the app, or I am going to cancel my subscription and go to move another music app.",1
"The Android app has gone steadily downhill since 2019. They've shown time and time again where all of their efforts have gone. Apple, podcasts, and ebooks. It constantly freezes, won't connect to Alexa, and takes long to open. They've removed feature after feature and replaced it with nothing. Where did playlists based off playlists go? Where did daily playlists go? Where did good song recommendations go?",2
"I don't know what happened, but it rearranged the songs in my playlist. Every time I try to correct the order, it takes the first couple songs and places them in the center of the list. When I put those songs back at the top, it takes a random song and places it above the ones I moved. And when I move that song, it takes the next couple song below it and putsthem elsewhere in the list. I know this seems silly, but it infuriates me. I'd like these songs in specific order, but it won't let me.",2
"Been having an ok time since i bought premium. No more incessant ads is nice. that was, until my playlists started going WRONG. i cannot sort. i cannot edit. making a new list with the same albums still magically teleports songs all the way to the top, swapping them with whatever is SUPPOSED to be there. deleting the errant song only brings in the next song from the errant song's album, not whatever is next in the list.",1
"Idk what's going on but there's a weird bug with the app. For some reason, all of my personal playlists that exceed 10 hours have songs at the top of the tracklist that I haven't moved. And whenever I rearrange the songs to go back in its order, another song pops up at the top of the list. I've never had a problem with the app until now. Please fix!",2
"Could be a great app. I love how the UI looks and the video and lyrics system is just very refreshing and beautiful coming from other similar apps. Also they have a great selection of music. But it's impossible to stream to a Yamaha MusicCast device. I've tried several devices, the connection starts, the song switches to playing, but no sound. There's been a thread for ages on the Spotify board. I will switch back to my previous music service app if this can't be fixed, sadly. Please fix it!",3
"DON'T BUY PREMIUM. This app is an absolute nightmare to use if you don't have a constant internet connection. You can't stream your downloaded music cause it refuses to work unless you turn on your data or wifi. Would give 0 stars if i could. UPDATE: ALMOST HALF A YEAR LATER AND IT'S STILL NOT FIXED Update 2: if you connect via bluetooth to anything, spotify doesn't recommend songs, it just plays the same playlist over and over every time. A quick google search proves this. Premium is useless",1
"I used to like the app but since recently the app is insanely slow. It takes forever to load your playlists, usually more than 10 seconds. Also, if I don't have an internet connection, some my playlists don't load at all! So basically I cannot play any music offline. EDIT: I reinstalled it and it still doesn't work. I don't want Spotify to use mobile data so I deactivated that in the Samsung settings but without internet connection Spotify doesn't load any of the offline music....",1
"1 star reasons: If I stop listening song at some part and start listening again then I can't restart the song from beginning I have to listen from the part I left it. I can't listen songs in order I want, smart shuffle is very bad. Limit has been set for skips. If I skip a song then instead of playing the song that is next in the playlist, it plays a random song from the playlist. I didn't have much problem with no. of ads before but now because of above points I would like to say too many ads.",1
"I LOVE Spotify, but there's certain features that bother me to no end. First, the shuffle feature. Doesn't exist. Spotify's shuffle chooses from your most listened to songs. Second, the ""videos"" that play with each artist should have an option to be turned off in settings. I'm in driving mode 24/7 just to avoid this. Other than that, I can live with everything else. I LOVE Spotify, don't get me wrong, but these features drive me absolutely nuts. Please fix them when you can.",3
"This app over all is amazing! However one small problem. Everything 3-4 songs in I get the same ads over and over again and I understand that premium is a thing but I think it's overpriced, and another thing it keeps playing the same songs over and over again and it wont play the songs I would like to listen to. The app is basically unusable if you don't have premium. And it sucks because everything and I mean EVERYTHING is limited. EX: the skips, if you don't have service! Fix this!",2
"Not bad at all. I use it a lot. I have some issues with it, but who doesn't with any app? 100% recommend over Pandora or iHeartRadio Edit: dropped it down to 3 stars because of two problems. One, podcasts don't pause. They made a recent update, I'm assuming, that causes the podcasts to play even though I hit the pause button. The only way to stop it is play music and pause, or close the app. Two, the AI DJ loops songs I've already heard or plays music that's different than what I listen to.",3
"This app used to be really good but now it has just been focused on how to make people buy the premium version... You don't allow me to rewind or play on loop, I can't skip more than 6 songs in a hour... you are just denying basic services... I'd rather listen to music on YouTube Music it's just better than you it just doesn't allow me to play music in the background well that works for me atleast I can play what I want to listen to.... I don't recommend this app at all... I am deleting it.",1
"I can find many songs in spotify, the experience was great, until they made almost everything premium. Not able to select and hear songs by our choice, not able to see lyrics for every song, not able to skip songs, not able to add any song to queue, not able to play songs in loop etc. Each of the following things always need premium for them to work I hope *at least* spotify changes even just 1 thing I mentioned. Let everyone, not only me, listen to songs in peace.",1
"Almost every month there is a feature, which definitely was authored by ""not very intelligent"" person. As example - you are not able to remove song from favorite in app anymore. Why? Algorithm for songs is very lazy - if you're listening song of certain genre, this song will be in playlist for months. Every ""renewal"" for playlist - mostly shanking up plus not or two new songs at best.",3
"Spotify is a completely dysfunctional, hard to use and limited app when you don't have premium. Not being able to see the next song, having limited skips, not seeing all lyrics etc. Are just a HANDFUL of problems. At this point the Spotify app is almost unusable unless you pay for an (expensive) subscription. The worst part is the app is only getting worse year by year. At this point, who's going to be even using Spotify in the next few years? When the right songs don't even play?",1
"Currently experiencing an issue with custom playlists where when adding multiple albums to one, random songs will jump to the top of the playlist and when I move them back to the place I wanted them, a different song(s) jumps to the top instead. Very annoying. Another issue - when listening to music via my phone speakers, the volume will randomly lower by itself.",2
"I was so impressed to see that Spotify has audiobooks now. When I started listening to one on a road trip however, I was shocked when a popup stopped my book from playing about 70% of the way through. ""Out of audiobook listening time. You can't buy more"". What an absolute shame. I now have to wait almost a month for it to reset. Why have audio books if you can't even listen to a single complete book in a month? Ridiculous.",1
"On my Samsung 23+ the app isn't working correctly when it comes to organizing my playlists that have 100+ songs, and each time I try to do the deep reset it doesn't fix anything and songs get shuffled from their original place.ent. even on my computer and old phone, the playlist looks fine and doesn't have any issues. As a reply to the developer, I have spoken to customer service, and they were unable to fix this. I was told I had to wait for an update to fix this issue.",3
"Lately, podcasts just haven't been loading (not a network issue). This typically happens when I'm trying to resume a podcast. The pause button displays as if it started. +It's been years since Spotify has made any significant UI changes and in this time they've introduced podcasts and books without adapting the platform very well for them. I should be able to have a podcast queue and book queue separate from my music queue so that switching between these categories doesn't clear the music queue.",2
"I hate this trend with apps constantly changing their UI in ways that are not necessary and not giving users options to customize it. Every time Spotify changed its layout, I got used to it pretty quick, but changing the heart to the plus just ruined the system I had with playlists. The fact that it also applied to car mode seems entirely counterintuitive to the point of car mode to keep the interface simple. There are other issues I have with current Spotify that I just can't fit in the review.",2
"honestly speaking, it's alright. I do have to take up a complaint with the new updates, especially the liking and adding to the playlist being combined. It's really inconvenient and difficult to use, and I truly believe that having the two separated as before is best (please give the heart back, the plus ruins the designs.) I think most of the changes have been for the worse recently.",3
"It's been a great app for me as a paid user of 7 years. Pros: Music offering is good and artist/song radio helps me find new music. Concert recs are nice! The latest offering of audiobooks has been a gamechanger. Cons: how janky the app becomes when I'm trying to use it offline. It often gets stuck loading downloaded content, or a playlist gets updated, but new songs don't get downloaded if I'm not on wifi, so I discover that some downloaded music isn't there when I'm commuting.",4
"Been a faithful user since my college days. But now, my local songs will just... Randomly unload themselves from my Playlists. It's frustrating when some Playlists are half local and half Spotify. Not to mention when it unloads your music if you accidentally hit smart shuffle. Whose great idea was that?! God forbid I'm on a trip and I can't sync my music. This app used to be great but I'm considering dropping it for good if this keeps up...",1
"Spotify used to be awesome and super easy to navigate. Now every single time it updates there is a new bug. It stops playing at random, it only plays the same 2-3 songs in a playlist, and top it all off, they will charge both you and whoever else you share the duo plan with. It is impossible to get ahold of them and if you are lucky to do so, they end chats or leave you hanging. Update: They canceled my account. Awesome. 2nd update: They cancelled my man's account and are still charging him.",1
"The the last few months, every time I'm playing Spotify in my car, the music shuts off randomly, unless I have the app opened on my phone. This is very annoying. Also, please stop it from automatically putting shuffle on every time I open the app. I don't like shuffle mode. And it's very inconvenient to have to open the app every time and turn off shuffle. There should be an option to keep this off unless it's wanted on.",4
"FIX THIS PLAYLIST BUG!! on my phone it mixes some of the songs in a playlist and puts the first song in the middle and a random one on top. as soon as i move the top song, another one appears. on my laptop, the order is correct, but the issues transfer from one device to the other. paying the subscription, i shouldn't have to deal with this",1
"I love this app. It allows me to put all my songs from different artists in one playlist, and I can organize it how I see fit. However I am having a problem with it. It will randomly take a song from halfway down my Playlist and stick at the top. When I edited it, put the song back where I wanted it, and saved it, it just put the song back. If I delete the song from the Playlist, it shoves a different song in its place. It's so infuriating.",4
"I have been using Spotify since it's inception, but the recent improvements make me wonder if Spotify is improving or retrogressing. That some important and traditional features -like ""replay""- are removed doesn't make any sense. I have deleted the app on two of my devices... You can return this feature and improve on what was not there before. That's more reasonable.",1
"Every time i wanna play a song in my playlist now it just plays some random part of the song for 20 seconds and then turns off. It was fine before then they ruined it like they always do. I cant even play my playlist anymore in the normal order, by just clicking a song and it plays start to finish and then the next one down starts playing, BUT NO, i have to rely on the random shuffle to play the song i want. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO RUIN ANY GOOD THING ABOUT THE APP!? IT WAS GREAT BEFORE. WAY TO GO!!",1
"Terrible app now. I have so many issues with playing podcasts, especially video ones. Sometimes I have to play a random song before it allows me to play it. Sometimes that doesn't even work, and I have to go play it on my computer for it to play on my phone. Garbage app. Spotify v1.0 was way better. Not only that my earphones loses track of the app and I'm unable to pause by tapping my earphones. I know it's spotify because I can pause YouTube and Audible just fine.",1
"Garbage app. Doesn't let me reorder my playlists without a subscription, so even people who pay for premium can't listen to my music in the intended order. Every time Im connected to bluetooth and open the app, it starts playing a random song automatically, taking me away from what I was looking at, STOPPING the media that was already playing on another app. This has been a known issue for years. GARBAGE APP, BAD DEVELOPERS. BAD. Only review I've ever left- the autoplay issue makes me see red.",1
"Usually I would rate a full 5 stars, but lately I've had an extremely frustrating issue with my playlists. Songs are being shifted to random areas in a playlist when I add a new song to that playlist, I cannot switch them back because another song just gets displaced instead of restoring the original order. I've cleared my cache and everything else but still no results.",2
"For the most part it's been good, I pay for premium. However, ever since the last update playlists that I make don't stay in the order I arrange them. For most playlist this is fine but there are some I made to be in a specific order. When I move the songs back to the order I want, it either doesn't save the changes or just reorders a different set of songs. I've tried updating and uninstalling the app and neither have fixed this. The app will also occasionally stop completely or freeze",3
"I deleted my earlier review because I thought a big problem had been fixed, but it's back. The app seems to really hate local files, as once again it has rendered 95% of them in all my playlists unplayable, even after a full reinstall, and it has affected my friend's app too so it appears to not be an individual issue. Spotify works well as long as you do not have local files, which to me is an extreme issue and thus rates it no higher than 2 stars. Spotify DESPERATELY needs competition.",2
"Some other problem has come up. Music periodically stops playing after one song. For example, when I play the first song on an album (which successfully plays through), the next song does not play. It is worth noting that the music player shows that the next song is playing when it isn't (this has gone on for as long as one hour on one song). Some kind of bug perhaps. Please address this in the next update.",2
"Spotify is very exclusive. Most of the songs I listen to on YouTube are not there because they only seem to have songs that are popular or from radio stations. Adding a long list of songs into a playlist is incredibly tedious because every time I click a song, it suggests 10 more completely random songs. [For anyone who likes music: Download YouTube then download Ublock Origin. Then you have unlimited free music without any interuptions. Much better than Spotify Premium or whatever]",2
"Loved Spotify until it started turning 'smart shuffle' on by itself. That really damaged my trust, when I tried to use familiar songs to manage an anxiety attack and got something completely different without any warning. No one wants this feature and there's no option to permanently disable it. I've started looking into other streaming services.",3
"Finally giving up on Spotify. No matter how many times I dislike certain ads, it keeps playing the same annoying one in every break. What's the point of disliking if they won't change it? Not trying to bash any brand or be negative, but seriously, I don't want to hear that annoying ad again and again. I get that ads keep the free version going, but come on. Thanks!",1
"not sure what's happening because it used to be fine a few weeks ago, but my music will randomly stop. it's as if the app crashed and I have to reopen it (loads as if I'd closed the app) to play my music again. what gives? this is obnoxious. during my commute my music stopped like 5 times randomly. playing in offline mode didn't help. i'm not paying $16 a month for this kind of experience. hope an update fixes this soon.",2
"Giving 1 star here because there's no way to rate the PS5 app that you guys have left broken for over a year. Ive been with Spotify since the very beginning but I'm about to drop it for good if you don't fix the bug that causes podcast episodes to start loading for a couple of seconds, only to have it skip to a random other episode. Spotify support have acknowledged that they knew about the problem all the way back in October 2023 and still haven't fixed it. It's happening to many people. Fix it",1
"Unbearable for non-premium users. Not like it used to be. You can't fastfoward to specific parts of songs, you can't replay them instead you have to go back into the app and re-click on the song to listen to it again, you can't go back to listen to the previous song. Not even an option for a queue to see any upcoming songs either. It's kind of over the top at this point. I understand that you're a company and are desperate for people to get premium but this is simply doing too much. Do BETTER.",3
Once upon a time Spotify was the best songs app but now it became a dictator. You can't play songs as per your wish the app itself play the songs in shuffle order of you select the playlist. You can't even play a song from middle of can't replay your favorite part of the song. You can't skip more than 6 songs per hour. Ads after every song and what not. You can get rid of this only if you take premium membership.,1
Honestly I don't know how Spotify gets away with having such a terrible app. There's so many bugs or crashes it doesn't make any sense for such a huge company to seemingly put so little effort into making an app that works. And the only that their support email offers is to uninstall and reinstall the app which means you'll have to go through and re-download anything you had previously saved. Not worth the price of premium.,1
"The app is overall very well designed and everything is well placed throughout the app but the reason I'm giving this 3 star is because of the amount of adds I'm getting for simply trying to change a song. I'll have an add, slip one song and have another add, and all the adds are so continuous. Also what is super annoying is that you can only skip a few songs in a day?? That total bs. Please fix this.",2
Playback has become atrocious. Whenever I start my podcasts there's no sound yet the you still see the progress bar moving as if it's playing. Always have to exit and re-open to get to work right and when it does start to work it suddenly stops playing again. Also wish these podcasts wouldn't bombard us with so many ads in between segments and episodes.,1
"I just tried to play a single song and it only played random other songs. Then when I added the song to a playlist, it added a bunch of other songs that it wouldn't let me delete and now I can't edit my playlists or skip songs. Thanks Spotify, I'm going back to YouTube Music. Had a great experience before the update, now all it does it shove random music in my face and block me from doing anything.",1
"I Like Spotify, but every few months it kicks me out of my family premium plan. When this happens it deletes all of my liked music. It puts me back to the same settings I had prior to signing up on Premium. The amount of lost time to recreate, and find what I had liked is so frustrating. Please fix this issue. Also the ""recover"" option doesn't work, as it says there's nothing to recover.",2
"1. we can't play another song in between 2. we can't navigate between the songs 3. we can't play the songs at loop nor can shuffle by our own choice 4. too many adds 5. we can't see the lyrics 6. the changed like icon is trash 7. another song starts playing even if it's not in the queue or your playlist i wish they could provide us basic facilities being a music app, i wish 0 starts was an option to rate. wonderful. CONGRATULATIONS!!!!",1
"I used the free Spotify for years and have found it easy to navigate and loved it which is impressive since I'm not great with technology! The only complaints I had were I couldn't skip more then 2 songs on my lists and after 2-3 songs 2 min of the same adds would interrupt which's annoying but manageable. My kid bought me a subscription as a Xmas present and I must say as a frugal person, it's well worth paying for the subscription I recommend bucking up the $$ it's great!!",5
"I've used Spotify for so long and mostly loved my experience, but Smart Shuffle is one of the worst additions I've ever seen since the inception of apps. It's one thing if you want to try implementing something like this as an optional feature, but setting it to on as default and being completely unable to deactivate it is ridiculous. I don't know if somebody needed to justify their job and tried making something new, but this has completely ruined the app for me.",1
"Garbage experience. There's too many ads. After 1 song or so, ads keep appearing. And the worst part is that the ads are a minute long. Absolutely frustrating. After the new 2023 update, it's gotten far worst. This greedy company has gone too far. Too many ads, Can't play any song on repeat, can't skip more than 6 songs, can't rewind the songs or play a certain part. Spotify is abusing it's free users. Dumb app, BOYCOTT it!",1
"This app was totally amazing when we were annoyed only by ads. But now we can't even listen to songs in peace. Thanks to the features you introduced which restrict us only 6 skips, we can't even listen to songs again and can't even move to our favourite part of the song. Everything here requires premium. This is really annoyed and ridiculous.",1
"The music selection and podcast variety is impressive and good considering that the app is free, it is a pretty good deal. The ads are at literally every corner, and most are 30 seconds long with no reward. I also can't play any music in the order that I want, most stuff is on forced shuffle, and you have to get premium to fix that. I have to pay to play the music I want... On a music app?",2
"Using earbuds if you click the button to pause it and bump it twice by mistake it skips to the next song. Kinda annoying when you are trying to pause it and unlock your phone to see what the song name is and save it to your favorite songs. Also there should be an option to keep volume within a couple of decibels of your phone volume. Really pisses me off when every other song or halfway through a song, I either can't hear it or it is blasting and constantly have to mess with volume.",1
"I have used Spotify Premium for years. I recently decided to eliminate a few costs and switched to the free service. At one point in time, I would have given Spotify 4 or 5 stars. I understand that you get what you pay for, but switching to free showed me how much Spotify absolutely sucks. They limit song skips, play one song, and then bombard you with repetitive ads. Plus when you're trying to listen to a specific artist or song, it switches to an entirely different artist/song at random.",1
"Updated review: Application needs OPTIMIZATION. The app loads for almost half a minute if you have a lot of audio downloaded. Even in ""Offline Mode,"" it still takes long to load. Even after a reinstallation and redownloading all of the music, it still takes almost half a minute to load (I have all of the music stored on the local storage). ||||| Actual review: Good music streaming app. It has loads of music, but some are sadly not available depending on the country you're in.",3
"Playlist songs will randomly swap places. And when I try and put it back where it was originally, it refuses to update or brings another song with it for no reason. It's incredibly frustrating, breaking the order I set it in for no reason other than to annoy me. Smart shuffle is okay until you get immense whiplash going from metal to kpop back to metal. Not to mention the recommendations are exactly the same until like 7 hours in. Great. Worst it's been in a while.",2
"Update. Clearly you either listen to things the Spotify way or not at all. This fact remains. They changed feature priorities though. Automix no longer turns on automatically. The new *it* feature is Smart Shuffle it turns on automatically, despite one of the whole selling points of paying is that you can listen in any order. Try to turn off? The app crashes. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone. App remains absolute garbage with no concern for the user.",1
"easily the most user unfriendly app I've ever used. some how it only keeps getting worse. can't go back to the previous song, can't replay a song, can't choose what song I want to play, only six skips in an hour and so much more? how are ads not even the worst part of this app? the cash grab is so blatant and so disgusting. they're lucky 0 stars aren't a thing. I would suggest absolutely not using spotify. there's plenty of better substitutes to give your money to.",1
"The only thing that's stopping me from deeming this a 1 star is the quality of the music. The ads are long and there's about 4 for each 3 or so songs. They're not even different ads, it plays the same ad at least twice in a row. Some of the ads are uncomfortable for me, and I'm not able to afford premium, so I will resort to a different music player.",2
"Offline mode is a nightmare. When you open the app, it takes for ever to load. Once it is open and you try to open a playlist it takes forever again, that's if it opens at all. More times then not it says there is a problem. Have to get online, switch back to online mode, get the playlist to open then switch back to offline mode. Major pain, I also do not have unlimited data!",2
"Spotify was my go-to for years- as a runner, It was great to have a playlist that I could add to, hit shuffle, and go 20 or 30 minutes w/quick, short ads. Now, there's a minute or more of ads for every 2 or 3 songs, and shuffle is gone. EVERY time I've opened the Android app, my playlist finishes whatever song I closed on & starts over. I have 100ish songs in my run list & can't get past the same 10 now, and I'm not the only one, apparently. I'm done!",1
"Constantly crashing and takes far too long to load music and functions. I've done what's recommended, soft and hard resets, amongst all the other advice given to me by spotify's FAQ section,but still, every time I open it's at least 3 or 4 minutes before I can access my library (even downloaded music and local files) and then could be another 2-3 minutes just for a song to begin to play! This has been a problem for a few months, every update that's come since has done nothing to fix these bugs.",1
"There's two things a strongly dislike with this app. First is how aggressive it is about auto playing. You open the app, it auto plays. You connect to Bluetooth, it auto plays, even if you previously paused it. This is very obnoxious. Unless I manually make it play something, I want it to remain off. Second, there's no obvious way to tyrn off this feature. There's a lot of options so many it's somewhere, but I shouldn't have to hunt it down. Is it so hard to include a search feature for options?",1
"What's with this with not able to add more than once for my fav song in the playlist??? As a premium user, this is very disappointing! Also, while playing, the song gets shifted to top by itself all the time, and even my shuffle is off. I have been paying for this app since 2018. Till to date, not all lyrics visible and no media interaction. Only a few get them with paid.",2
"What can be worse than not being able to go to previous song? Spotify : Challenge accepted. 6 skips an hour. Cant go back, cant go next either. What next? Demo versions of songs? play first 20 seconds, buy premium for full song? We understand adds, but taking away the choice of what song user wants to listen defeats the core purpose of creating a music app. Shame.",1
"I love spotify, and honestly couldn't live without it, but the app is so buggy all the time. I run the updates as soon as they are available, I clear my cache, I restart my phone and the app, and still I run into issues. I pay for premium and let this app bleed my battery and storage space dry, and it just keeps getting worse. They know there isn't another option out there and they have no motivation to keep the app running smoothly. It's frustrating.",3
"I heard Spotify has the best recommendation of songs, but telling from my personal experience, it doesn't. When you search a particular song it just keeps on playing that song on loop no matter what kind of song you have played before and whats the mood of the song. At some point, I even started hating the songs because Spotify played it so many times even though I've not put that in my liked songs. I suggest Spotify developers to fix the (so-called) bug ASAP.",1
"No issues with the music. As a premium user I was delighted when Spotify included audio books to listen too. However, I've given up. The audio keeps stopping for no reason. I have tried all the usual things. Log out, log in. Uninstall blah blah. So frustrating. I'm thinking of ditching in favour of Amazon. The response from developer is obviously automated and totally unhelpful. I shouldn't have to contact them. I've already detailed what happens in my review. One star deducted.",2
"I used to love Spotify. But ever since the premium thing popped up, it's became really annoying. 1)I can't skip to specific parts of the song. 2)I can't replay a song. 3)There is a limit to even choose the music you wanna play. 4)You can't get more than 6 skips per hour. 5)It doesn't allow to play songs in queue. 6)It only allows to play the playlist in shuffle. 7)There are so many ads and on top of that, 2 at a time. Well, that's pretty much it. I hope this issue gets fixed!",1
"I love the fact that you can save music and play it when out of cellular range. I like the oldies and have yet not to find a song or artist that I've searched for. The price for duo is great if you love mood altering music. It's fun and enjoyable to explore and listen to different and new music broadening my scope. The reggae Christian music is something different for me, and I love it. Spotify opened my eyes or should I say ears to all kinds of music that I probably wouldn't have explored.",5
"Mobile verson has always been trash, but now it won't even play the songs I have in a playlist anymore even if I have over 50 songs in it. Edit in response to below: Last time I had an actual issue with the app that wasn't just even more features being taken away from non premium users; I had to answer the same questions over a dozen times to a different person each time, even with video proof of the issue and all the trouble shooting I did, before they would actually do anything about it.",1
"Honestly the more I use the new plus button the more I hate it. The functionality is not anywhere near better for to use case. Please give me the option to choose I realized this interface is not ideal when I imported playlists from another service. It creates a playlist and it is impossible to tell if the songs are ""liked"" unless I play them, and then click the already checked button. So many steps for what used to be so simple brain dead design",2
"Worst update ever. Even the basic features for a streaming app is converted to premium feature. Whats the use of this if we can't even properly play the songs we like. Just think about playing a song for the wedding and suddenly it plays a random song that just wouldn't fit the vibe! We users are extremely disappointed with this. If this goes on, the app is gonna get boycotted. Bring back the previous version.",1
"Frequently unresponsive on startup and claims that there is no internet connection when there is and other apps have no problem accessing it. Often needs to be restarted a few times to get it working. Even songs and albums that I have downloaded won't play in this situation. Also gapless playback fails more often than it works. For such a widely used app, the quality is lacking.",3
Overall a great app but with some frustrating bugs that can really ruin your listening experiences. Sometimes songs in queue are skipped and the bug that you can't pause using the button on the touchscreen at the moment between songs has been there for years. Don't know how that can happen. Also there is no convenient way to report bugs.,4
"People need to stop bending over for Spotify they keep making the app more annoying to deal with, instead of letting us put the pointless features they are there no matter what. Besides that, the app gets super buggy with shuffle and ""retarted shuffle"" every time I take it off it goes to the beginning of my playlist. I don't want that there's a reason why I took it off to begin with. Not to go all the way back to the playlist. This is why I don't pay for Spotify anymore and just take it off web.",1
The app randomly stops at the current version. Also the premium version is right now useless as too much advertisements get flooded into through the platform. The overall experience is solid but lately it was disappointing as the stability is not there and the app is focusing on pumping out more ads and space to place advertisements. I guess it is a matter of time till the problems are fixed but right now I would avoid using Spotify and use different apps.,2
"Spotify randomly messed up playlists I've been using and adding to for years now. I logged on about 20 minutes ago and realised most of my playlists have had the order randomised, and random songs I don't have on them have been added, while others have been taken off. I'd really like to know if there's someway to fix this as Spotify is where I keep and organise ALL my music. Edit: Nevermind, think it's fixed for now at least",4
"Spotify is my favourite music app. However, lyrics no longer work, it has an ""about the artist page"" instead, even though there are lyrics to the song. I've looked it up but I can't find anything to fix it. Please remove this feature to tell me how to fix it! I've cleared the cache on the app and it still isn't working..",2
"Didn't have ads the first month of spotify, then there are ad breaks longer than some of the songs on my lists. What a scam. This has made me stop listening sometimes because the ads are NOT skipable and louder than my songs. Very frequent as well! Other than these awful ads, it's a decent app. But if this isn't fixed soon I am switching to some other music app. I am not wasting money on premium just to stop ads. I'm okay with them, if they are shorter and less frequent. Popups are fine too.",3
"ATTENTION SPOTIFY COMMUNITY How has Spotify not yet fixed this issue! Spotify WAS great..... but now: The 2019 ""fix"" update which redesigned the editing playlist look is SO bloody annoying...If you find a song you want out of a playlist which you are playing, when you toggle and edit the playlist it should come up GREEN to signal you are playing it like it used to! It doesn't! I noticed so soon after the update came out. How has spotify not fixed this already! Pretty silly, don't you think?",1
"Love it, but oh my god. I have premium duo and, listen, this app undownloaded all my music randomly, deleted my playlists while I was offline and sometimes just shuts down for no reason. I love all the music and the fact that's some songs are exclusive to the app, but please. If you listen to music all day like me, don't be surprised if this happens to you. It isn't the end of the world, it's just... annoying. The miniclips that make you listen to a little part of the song are nice tho❤",3
"Overall like this app, easy to navigate, finding songs i love is easy, and the algorithm is decent for finding new music. Edit: it will play the ""30 min ad free"" ads, however i keep getting ads before the 30 minutes are up. I even have screenshots of this happening. Its incredibly annoying, especially when the app seems to glitch and i get ad after ad. At one point i had gotten 14 in a row and had to repeatedly close and open the app to stop it",2
"It's an absolute joke. When you first sign up it gives you a couple weeks of free premium without even telling you, hence believing that the premium is actually just the standard layout, but no, after the weeks wear out without it even telling you, the playlists are screwed up, shuffle is always on so you can't listen to your music in order or choose the song you want, you can't skip back songs to listen again and you only can skip 6 songs an hour!!! The most money hungry app you'll ever see",2
"Great app overall, but this new + instead of old green icon is not an improvement. I liked knowing which songs I had already saved to my ""liked songs"" just by the green icon. Speaking of liked songs, there need to be searching, sorting, and organizing options. It would help with removing duplicates and remembering specific songs. Also please add hide song to the DJ so I never have to hear a certain song again.",4
***edit to say problem was resolved and app is a 10 again*** Love spotify. But lately it keeps pausing randomly either till I go to my phone and press play again or 1 sec after it pauses and anywhere in between. Nothing seems to be triggering the pause. Am I being hacked or is this a technical issue. It's frustrating but I don't want to get rid my spotify.,5
"This app works but is not very good. If you search for a song, it'll play the song once, but after that, you need good luck to try and find that song. Oh, but wait, you only have six song skips every thirty minutes. When using this app as an alarm, it changes the song used each time the alarm goes off. If there's a playlist, it'll show the name of the album, but not songs. Plus, it plays the songs in whatever order the app says is best. If you pick one song, it'll play a complete other song.",1
"Impossible to find anything, difficult to navigate. Pay to skip songs? That's like paying to unlock thumbnails. Sometimes I search a song, find the exactly right title, and it's labeled as ""song"", but it then instead plays something else entirely. I click ""don't play this"" and it says ""song removed from list"". What list? It's one song. It's labeled ""song"" not ""list"". I asked for a song, and was told I could listen to it, but actually not? ""Browse music, but actually no you're out of skips sorry""",1
"I've been using Spotify for almost 10 years now, it has served me well. But now, it has been changed a lot. Like they replaced the heart button (Liked button) by a plus button to add it faster to a playlist which it already exists on the menu (3 dots on the top right) now it's confusing to add it or just like it. Secondly, the suggestion songs are more than the main songs, it's annoying. Last but not least, WHY ALL THAT CASH??? WHAT ARE YOU STORING ON MY PHONE???? Sometimes it hits 5GB.",3
"Spotify is trying to make it as hard as possible to listen to music, when you play an album, some songs that are no where NEAR the said album randomly play , with no way of turning that off without buying premium, secondly, it does the same thing to Playlists, playing random songs that aren't even in the Playlist with no way of turning it off as stated before.",1
"I love this app and this was an issue for me before, but the app loves now since a recent update, to close out when I'm not staying in the app. Example- I'll be scrolling through Facebook or something and Spotify will completely stop playing whatever music. or when I have my screen turned off it'll do the same, especially if I have another app opened that isn't spotify. not my first time this has happened and it's really frustrating. Fix this.",3
"App updated last night and it now crashes on start up. I have been unable to open it since it was updated. I have tried restarting my phone, force stopping the app, clearing the cache etc. I am reluctant to uninstall/reinstall the app due to having 24GB of music downloaded for offline use and I am going on a month long trip abroad in 2 days. I will not be able to listen to music on this trip. Very disappointing.",2
"I absolutely love Spotify, so it kills me to give it such a low score, but as of late this app has become a dumpster fire. If I'm not connected to wifi (I have no service), then it literally takes 5-10 minutes just to load the home screen, god forbid I try to change the album or song. I've been using this app for years. Help me to understand why this is happening, and reprimanded whoever ruined this app with a garbage update.",2
"With the problems that have never been fixed for months but they'll update and keep adding more functions, top of this the features that we like are now gone, and Spotify has just added several functions to replace what was already good. And any existing functions when playing tracks like the shuffle button has never worked for me in the past several (good amount of) updates. If you unclick shuffle it will reset your whole queue to play from your first liked songs no matter what when how or why.",3
"The app just seems to have to many glitches. Song randomly stop playing. The app CANNOT handle transitioning from one device to another. Almost always stops the music playlist entirely. Used to be the best app, but not its intolerable at times. NO MORE GLITCHES!.edit 2/6/24 still having issues with being able to use it on multiple devices at one. Spotify is trash, they cant fix anything.",1
"Honestly, I used to love spotify so much. It was my go to music platform, but recently I feel like it's nothing more than a cash cow. Premium is required just to listen to the songs you want, and it keeps adding songs I don't like into my playlist. And if I want to have actual control over my playlist I have to pay $10.99 USD per month, and I just don't have that kind of money. The app is so good before the premium requirement feature was implemented. Please, I'm beggin, make spotify free again.",2
"Just gets worse with each release. Great content, dismal usability and design. I'm constantly amazed by just how bad the design of this hugely popular all is. In particular the playlist/queue/shuffle functions. I appreciate that many users won't listen to a whole album as released but prefer to use playlists etc. However a simple task like putting on a single album to play now, in the normal order, is both opaque and often requires endless clicking to purge the current one before you can start.",2
"I enjoy listening to songs on loop, and this app doesn't allow you to loop songs in autoplay so you need to put them in a separate playlist, and when you do that you can't switch to the next song because it will stop being looped and you have to go back into the app and turn it on again. The UI is also clunky. Zero out of ten I regret spending money on this. Just use YouTube Music premium instead.",1
"I really love this app although I'm disappointed that all of a sudden after listening to an album/playlist, it starts to play it from the beginning again rather than just continuing on with recommended songs from that genre. Playing your album/playlist on random mode doesn't always give you a good mix of songs. 53hrs of music in my playlist and I've listened to the the whole Queen album within the first 2 hours. I've uninstalled the app and it's even had an update and still no change.",4
"new review. you guys keep messing up the shuffle button, with no option to remove ""enhanced"" shuffle in settings. bad app, dont pay for it. edit 11/15/23: they changed the liked songs function and now you can no longer quickly tell which songs you have liked in an album/playlist. edit 2/8/24: you can now no longer add playlists to your profile. incredible stuff, spotify. you're making this app worse with every update.",2
"My app keeps crashing or is 'set to offline' even though my data is on. I wish I could add pictures but one day I'm playing music in glorious bliss and the next, I'm being asked to 'add music or podcasts'. Where does my liked music and set lists go? And this has happened three times within November and February. I've had to uninstall the app and reinstall. I enjoyed it for a few days before my play lists disappear. This is just frustrating! And I'm on premium in case you were wondering.",2
"This app requires the option to shut off auto replay. It is intrusive, to say the least. I've reached out, chatted, and followed every instruction given, and it seems that even the staff doesn't know how to stop the app from playing automatically. Even if Spotify wasn't an app previously used, it will begin playing when connected to the car.",1
"I have paid for my spotify but it still shows I am on the free plan. Kindly have this fixed! Thanks. I have tried everything including updating it,emailing, restarting my phone and it us getting quite annoying that I have to listen to music with adverts, yet I am on a subscription which makes it really frustrating. I need it fixed as soon as possible.",3
Just found out there is limited listening time when it comes to audiobooks. Unlimited music but not with audiobooks. This feels dumb considering I'm already paying for a premium subscription. If you fall asleep and waste your minutes you have to wait almost a month for them to refresh or pay a fee to top-up your minutes. This feels like a punishment. It's a sneaky business practice. I might as well pay for Audible if I'm going to be paying extra anyway. Not happy.,2
"I been a user for 6 years now and I seen more and more problems with the app in the past year then the years before. Updates are patchy and the more recent issue that hasn't gone away in updates is the kicking out of current playlist after connecting or disconnecting to any Bluetooth devices. Once this happens the app will start playing a random playlist not picked. Also once disconnected the app reads ""Offline"" then back online. Another recurring issue is Queued songs clearing",2
Needs an option to block songs from playing entirely. There's an artist I enjoy but one of his songs irritates the absolute hell out of me. No matter how often I remove from playlist it always gets shuffled to a new one. My only option was to block the artist entirely since I really hate hearing the song and if Im doing something while I listen to spotify I cant always go over and skip it. It feels like such a simple thing that it amazes me how its not already part of spotify.,3
"This is still the slowest app. Has to connect to internet before it shows anything. downloaded content stops playing when Internet is flaky. keeps deleting downloaded content. randomisation of playlists is not really random (buttons once was fun, but 3 times in 5 hrs when you have another 20 hrs to choose from). music album switches back to podcast queue. pod queue additions are not a podc I've listened to before. can't block or delete pod suggestions & down vote does nothing. Improve or we move",1
"2 stars because when I downloaded it was pretty good. No issues nothing actually. But now today o coudnt listen to songs because I was busy. When I went to my playlist it was all changed. I couldn't see my songs and there was just the names of the songs. When I clicked it, it just played a random part, not the full song. It's just very much annoying and irritating. It would be great if it was changed back to the way it was. This really bad. And YouTube let's you do all these for FREE.",2
"A couple of things: Firstly, the app is decent. However, idk why, but lately, when listening to podcasts, the app won't automatically play the next episode. It looks like it's going to, but nothing happens. The only way to actually get the next episode to work is to close the app and reopen it. Secondly, I have a paid subscription, yet I'm still getting ads. Thankfully, I can skip them by fast forwarding them, but still, it should be ad free.",3
"I've had it for a year now and i was all fine till the last update, when I try to play one of my playlists, it plays the first song and then every song after I've never heard before, And when I try to listen to my long playlist In the order I have them in It plays the first song at the top and then it's like it's shuffled when it's not on shuffle. It keeps randomly crashing, and I find it annoying when you tap a song and have listen to 4 ads It makes it harder to find the song you're looking for",1
"Spotify was such a good app to listen music, with lyrics and a variety of great music. You could even explore new songs with it's new feature in the playlist section, it would add songs in the playlist according to the particular kind of playlist. You could even put a song on repeat, now? Nah. It has become trash. Every little thing needs a premium now. A person can't even listen music peacefully without spending money on apps. As the app gets new updates, it keeps getting worse. Disappointing.",1
"Got updated for the prices' increase, so I'm waiting for actual improvements, not just a curly line VS a straight line to indicate a song is playing. I see updates, but not actual improvements. The app stops playing music mid song, nothing changes on my phone, the app just dies. Also, when I choose a song to listen to and it's not with shuffle option, the music will stop after that song. If I pick the next in line, it'll start playing but with the shuffle option. Make it work.",1
"Used to be pretty good. pauses on me for no reason, Which is pretty distracting while driving. New shuffle is terrible and the regular shuffle sucks. Ill hear the same music whether going through all of my likes or a playlist ive been binging. Might be time to find another way to listen to music. Also not a fan of smart shuffle, i dont like having to tap the shuffle button twice to toggle it.",1
"I have had great experience using Spotify!!! Since I could not afford the subscriptions earlier, I put on my opinion on reducing the amount in the survey and it was considered promptly which came to me as a surprise! When I got the offer for subscription for a cheaper price, I did not think twice and subscribed for an year! Loved it P.S - Spotify is the best advertising app when it comes to pushing people for subscriptions! 🤣",4
"i have used spotify for years and the only reason i was able to tolerate the ads is because when on pc i can just close and reopen the app and the ad is gone. but my laptop is broken now and on mobile it's practically useless without premium, constant ads, can't skip forever, can't select songs. every day it suddenly stops my music and refuses to load when i go to the app. i gave in and bought premium but once it runs out in a few days i will be moving to another platform.",1
"Spotify Pro User here. I like the wide selection Spotify offers. You can also download songs to your device and add them to playlists if it's not available. However, something that is VERY annoying is the shuffle feature. I dont want an algorithm choosing what songs it thinks I want next; i want either truly random picks or a psuedo-random selection that tries to play each song in even distribution. My 1000 Liked Songs playlist sounds like I only have 40 songs in there!!!",3
"Love the crossfads opgion and love the transition between the songs. HOWEVER, it mostly sucks on mobile, why should I get premium just to pick a song from MY playlist, its my playlist, I made it, why can't I choose which song I want to play first? Or why can I only skip six songs per hour? Not to mention I cant turn off smart shuffle or reguñar shuffle for any playlist, its so annoying.",1
"I used to love Spotify, but it is soooo repetitive on it's music selection even across channels. New releases are never mixed into any channel. God forbid you like a band that has been around for a decade or two. You will only hear their old stuff, even if you only listen to that band. How do you have so much music but make it such a pain to listen to most of it. Just not worth it anymore.",2
"I always use this app, no question....until now. There's this bug on the app that doesn't play the first song on my playlist, and when I try editing it it switches to a whole new song, messing up my playlist in the process. This has become detrimental in me using the app and I'm hopeful that nobody else is experiencing this issue. That being said I hope that this issue is resolved before that can happen to others",2
"What's going on!? Why is the app suddenly unusable? I'm constantly struggling to play spotify on any echo via the app, echo works fine but the app doesn't recognise that a song is playing so I can't change it unless I ask alexa. It's just a loading screen for every song I've downloaded when I try to listen offline on my phone. It also suddenly goes silent partway through a song at random times. Why am I paying for a service that doesn't deliver!?!? Sort it out!",1
"Don't pay for this Spotify premium is a huge waste of money, the downloaded episodes routinely become ""unavailable"" to play. (I don't have reception at work so being downloaded is a big deal) There's a lot of ads, even on the premium version. Overall, not worth it by any means. If you have good wifi/data just use the free version. I got logged out, it's now not letting me log back in. Down to 1 star now",1
"An amazing app usually, but it often happens that podcasts bug out - it shows just a black screen and doesn't want to start. Not even changing to a different podcast or clearing the cache works. For some reason it works after casting to another device, but not on the phone. EDIT: Seems turning the internet connection off and on helps.",3
"This used to be my go to place during times of distress,sadness,happiness,excitement or simply when I was elated due to the party mood. But recently the updated version is so disgusting as they have restricted the minimalistic features like song shuffle, choosing a song, song repeat which makes it very tiring and exhausting to keep on listening. This was my favourite app where I always encouraged more of my friends to use this and now I feel its of no use. So disappointed !",1
"I've been using Spotify for a few years and only have just a few complaints about needing to have premium just to play a song on loop or to play a specific song. I can never search up a song and it just plays, instead it automatically plays a playlist. Ad's are a little too frequent, like ever three songs there's an ad. Anything besides that, everything else is good.",4
"2/10/24 UPDATE! I'm still experiencing the random shuffling of custom playlist everyday. I have premium. 4/27/23 Update! Still hanging on and doing fine EXCEPT THIS ONE THING! About once every two weeks or so, my custom playlists will get stuck on shuffle. The only way to get them unstuck is to log out, uninstall, reinstall and log back in. It's quite annoying. It would be a lot easier if we had the option to stop shuffle for podcasts like we have with music and music playlists.!",3
"Where as my original review I was completely satisfied with the app. The new changes have me rethinking. Random songs appear as I'm playing my liked songs, not once have I ever liked a lady gaga song or Billy Joel's the piano man. Also I'm getting ads in my podcasts even though I have premium membership and the add selection to place a new song in my liked list is met with another selection to place in a different playlist. My suggestion is don't change something that ain't broke.",3
"Every time is getting worst. Not only they put a lot of more and more frequent ads, they limit you to hear your playlist to almost force you to get the premium. Also when they say enjoy the next 30 min. Ads free, the ads still showing up. Another thing I hate, it' s when I look for discovering a new song I have to listen the full album",2
"I love Spotify, I'm an avid user but recently I keep having problems. The app keeps crashing when playing music in the background and it struggles with downloading music (not to mention the minutes long start-up time). Hoping that these are issues that get fixed. I've uninstalled and redownload the app about 3 times now and the issues still remain.",2
Great way to listen to music with a huge library of songs to chose from. If you have a sleep playlist there is a sleep timer you can set so your phone is not always on. Though the app has been really annoying lately by automatically putting itself in the background and playing music when i dint want it to.,3
"I just have one issue and I don't know if it's a bug or not, but I literally can not add any of my playlists to my profile, the option completely disappeared, meaning if I take them off my profile, I can never put the back on, which is a hassle to deal with when I am trying to reorganize my playlists. Also, if I'm listening to a podcast episode, it says I'm listening to the previous music I was listening to, or a completely random song",3
"I have used Spotify for years and am a premium subscriber. Lately this app has gone backwards big time. It is unstable and crashes, it used to remember what episode you were up to in a podcast list now it automatically goes to the top and you have to scroll through until you find where you were up to and it used to be when you liked an album it automatically added the songs to your library, now you have to add them all individually. Such a shame a once user friendly app has become a mess",3
"Love this app in general, but the last 3 weeks it has become decreasingly reliable. Initially it would take minutes to load, so I uninstalled and re-installed (losing local files :( ) which fixed it short term until eventually slowing down. Then today it stopped functioning entirely, only crashing. Edit: update fixed the crashing but still very slow on startup",4
Why can't i alter audio and video quality anymore!!! This app is getting so bad!! Getting sick of it changing to internal storage when I always pick external. How many times do I have to delete the cache then the app to have to reinstall for it to only work for a day or so. Been like it for nearly a year. I have to delete reinstall and then download 30gb of music again. Constantly telling me its offline.,1
"Hey Spotify Team! I've been having an issue where my playlists that are entirely podcast episodes are set to shuffle, and I cannot change this. I have looked up how to fix this, but apparently this ""bug"" is now a new feature! My family and I are paying for Spotify Premium, but if these sorts of updates continue, I think we'll have to move to a new music app! If you respond, please have an actual fix for this ""new feature,"" it's very disappointing.",3
"So frustrating, for some reason Spotify stopped casting to my Google Home and Mini roughly one week ago. Our Sirius casts fine. I uninstalled/reinstalled, cleared cache etc. Just says it connecting, yet it doesn't. I cannot cast verbally nor a direct connect from phone. Ugh!!! Update: this morning when I verbally asked Spotify to play some music, it actually did. Hopefully this was just a blip in the system.",4
"This has been a bad experience for me so far. It never actually plays the songs in my playlist and instead plays similar songs, even when I turn off the 'play similar songs' button in the settings, it doesn't work. It never lets me skip songs, and whenever I try to play my playlist now it tells me I can't You should fix this Spotify :(",2
"I love using my Spotify app on my Chromebook! It is way better than listening to Youtube, which has adds. I do not own Spotify Premium and I never get adds! I do have a couple of issues, but I will keep my rating at 5 star! My app just laggs a bit and only lets me play certain songs in my school district. But other than that I love spotify! Definetly recommend!",5
"No, just no, I'm not going insane just to listen to my music with my phone off, this app isnt even a music app at this point, it's just 60% adds every song, we can't replay songs, we can't put songs on loop, there's more adds then last year, and we only have 6 skips, and most of the songs I like aren't even on this app, YT music is better, I'm still gonna keep this app because I can listen to two of my favorite songs on the bus in the morning..",1
"Utter pants, the mobile app barely works. They took away all the user friendly features , and replaced it with pretty videos on the home page, bravo! In the old versions, you used to be able to display all liked albums in artist order (alphabetical) then they removed it. GIVE IT F***ING back!! All I do is listen to albums, and I like to flick through the artists to find what I want to listen too, why have you removed it?!?!?!???! Please don't force me to revert my phone OS to play Spotify again",2
"App keeps changing playlist song orders and removing songs (but not showing it). If you change the song that is at the top, another is swapped into its place at random. Genuinely frustrating Constantly freezes,doesn't load playlists (gets stuck in a loading loop), crashes. How does it even fail to load playlists that are saved offline? Isnt that the entire purpose",1
"I really want to love this app. Ive been using it for years and did really like it up untill recently. The app used to be good even without premium but not anymore. the amount of adds are unreal. You get 5 adds per 1 song and they lie when they tell you ""listent to get 30 min of no adds"" The playlists are kind of useless too, it will repeat 20 song out of the 100 song paylist, you won't ever get to hear the other 80. Spotify, please, this is getting ridiculous.",2
I wish we could custom arrange our playlists like we can arrange the songs inside the playlists. I wish Spotify would stick to playing the one band I search for in my playlist instead of playing a different artist after the song is over. I also wish Spotify would let you read lyrics without having to hear the song... sometimes I just wanna make sure it's the correct song without having to google search for it.,1
"I'm a person who suggested spotify to many. I loved spotify before. And now I've started to get irritated by this app. Adds are fine, but not able to repeat same song and not able to move song backwards and forward is tooooooo irritating. This feature made me see other music platforms. Very bad experience for those who love music, and nothing less than a emotional pain for those who listen songs on spotify for almost entire day.",1
I love being able just to open my Spotify and search a song and find it sometimes... The only thing I don't like about Spotify is how I can't get all the songs. For example you can't find Lil Wayne's any of the mixtapes or sorry for the wait albums on Spotify you have to go to YouTube. I prefer Spotify because it is a better service but at the same time I don't get all the music that I want.,4
"Why have you removed the ability to have atuo repeat albumn, without having to turn on each time? Have premium.. decent enough. I only use for music, which I could remove features from home screen. Like podcasts, audio books, hot right now list (filled with artists/genres I don't ever listen to) new panel dosplay section at bottom.",4
"This app is pretty good, even without the premium. Now, though, when i come back to the app after work, it auto plays some random music (i listen to power metal! not whatever random music y'all want me to try), and when i play podcasts, it normally goes from oldest to newest, but sometimes it'll play the last episode over again 😑",2
"Another poorly made app by developers who refuse to listen to users. It's BROKEN! It cannot handle losing internet connection - it won't just play the downloaded songs, it just tells you it's in offline mode. You can't dismiss anything from the home screen, so you can be stuck with icons for podcasts you don't listen to or songs you don't like. What a pathetic failure of an app. I'm a premium user and I'm done with Spotify! Moving over to Amazon Music for sure",1
"Works great until it stops playing and then it needs reinstalled & all the music needs downloaded again. Update: Thanks for replying. I visited the support site & the troubleshooting for Spotify not playing includes reinstalling the app and redownloading the music. It seems there's an acknowledgement of the issue with the app. If the issue with the app can't be fixed, then allow reinstallation of the app without having to download the music again. This costs us data. Will reach out to support.",4
"At first I gave this app a 5, but lately on my android phone and my laptop the music plays 3-4 songs and just stops. No ads, it just stops. I have to restart the app to hear a few more songs before it stops again. So 👎right now until the app is fixed. Yo creaters...fix the problem please. After deleting the app from all devices AND logging out. Then reinstalling and logging back in, it seems to be working now. For how long, hard to say.",3
"Introduced/reintroduced ads between songs Feb 2024, was pleasantly surprised to not have unrelevant advertisments shoved in my ears between every couple songs upon downloading the app, and not having premium, but all of a sudden this has changed... Spotify is now literally the worst user experience, imagineable, for an audio streaming app. Literally no reason to choose this over Apple/Amazon music again, ill sign up for the free premium offer, then never use Spotify again on expiry, cheers.",1
"I love using Spotify and have been using it for many years. Recently I have been having a problem with it just stopping. Like I'll be in the middle of my music and it just completely stops playing. I have to go into the app, wait for it to load and then hit play and pause a few times before it starts playing normally again. This happens sometimes as much as 5 times in a 15 minute commute to work. I want to keep using Spotify so please fix!",2
"This app gets worse and worse. Bring back the heart to like songs. Now it glitches out and says I don't have a song in my likes so I add it, but then it has a duplicate song in there. makes 0 sense. Also your ""liked"" songs playlist should have the same options as a regular playlist. You can't share your liked songs as a playlist? And you can't duplicate your liked songs playlist.",1
"I'm paying for premium yet I can't listen to most of my songs. It will play one and then stop. Forcing me to have to relaunch the app. Then when I go out of offline mode, it constantly says the is no internet connection when I have full bars. This is really frustrating especially since I'm paying for this. It used to work great but lately it's been terrible. Please fix immediately. I don't want to go back to pandora but it's free and no problems like this",1
"I've been up for a long time trying to figure out why I can not connect my Yamaha wireless speakers to spotify! I have recentlyupgradedphones from a IPhone to SamsungS24 Ultra and since doing so can not for the life of me connect the speakers. They just simply won't play music through it nor will it show up on available to link and play. I used ITunes and never had a issue, moved to Spotify and ran into a brick wall. Nothing on the website helps to fix the problem! Surely this can be fixed!?",2
"Stops playing randomly and will often repeat the same short cycle of songs in a playlist. Also, customer support has not been helpful. They just say to restart and reinstall, which I've done several times. And now they make an audiobook require payment WHILE I was listening to it?? Here I thought it was included in premium up to like 12 hours or something. Greedy corpos. I pay them enough for this waste of data 🙄 Edit: I edit everytime these bugs occur. Also, why is it so painfully slow now?",1
This is the worst update ever. You have to pay to skip the song or repeat it. We need to pay to play the songs in order. This is my favorite music app and I am using it for almost 2 and a half years. This account is used on various devices. Why are you making us to pay for the essential or the main features for the comfort of the customer. You're getting worse . The app's playing random songs which we don't want to hear at that moment. Pls make it more usable and normal like the previous update.,1
"this app gets worse with every update, its at the point now where it is placing random songs from tge middle of a playlist at the start of it. I can not move the songs back to their original place, as it just ignores any changes I make and removing the bugged song results in the next song from its original position being placed at the top.",1
"Spotify on the mobile app sucks. If I were you. I rather go on to the website version. I'll atleast be able to switch or pick the music/songs that I want to listen without premium, but the ads will definitely annoy you. But this is portable and nobody is gonna bring out their laptop just to listen to some tunes. That would be ridiculous and silly. I would only use this if I'm doing anything physical with my legs. Laptop/computer if I'm relaxing or sitting down. And no loop!? Seriously!?",2
"I know I put 4 stars but this was before the glitches I gues you could call them. Only just recently the top song on my play list, like the first one I added has randomly moved halfway down the play list and been replaced with another one. Then when I try and move it it's adifferent song that takes its place. So I restarted my phone and had a look and nothing changed. Deleted the app and now I can't even redownload it..",4
"Spotify has now keeps changing my music orders in the playlist, which is not right. Plus, this Smart Shuffle is pointless as it's added other music that's not in my playlist to Shuffle. You can't even Turn Off Smart Shuffle I'm the settings if you don't want instead you'd had mess around with Shuffle button but doesn't fix it when the notification say its off but its actually still on. I'm definitely going to look at alternative & or go back to downloading making playlists the old way.",1
"I used to use Spotify mobile all the time before the most recent big update that changed the entire app. My biggest complaint is the ""recommended songs."" They can be pretty annoying when you're trying to listen to specific songs in a playlist/album. In my opinion, just use the desktop version if you do use Spotify.",2
"First of all great app. But a ton of problems I'm not gonna be one of the people who'll complaining about ads, I understand you need them to make money and possible people off so they eventually get the premium subscription but reducing the features is inhumane, not being able to choose the next song I want is not a good idea, it's terrible. And not being able to repeat a song or keep it in a loop, where do you guys get these ideas. It doesn't help anyone 😕.",3
I loved Spotify until recently. Now the app will randomly close and mess up my queues and I often listen to Spotify while driving so then I'm stuck in silence u till I get a chance to hop on my phone and fix it. I have even talked to my friends about it and they have the same problem. It is on ny absolute last nerve and I am about stop paying for Spotify premium and switch to another music streaming app.,1
"Edit: It constantly closes, crashes while running, freezes, wont pause or play when you push the buttons and video is spotty. I updated it and problems still persist. I am so glad JRE is going to youtube again, this app is trash. Now it randomly skips to next episode, then when i go back, it starts over. Consistently closes or wont pause, then the pause/play button and marker line at the bottom stays on the screen until i touch around it. Just little things that shouldn't be an issue.",1
"Great music app, but I've been having a problem recently, for some reason on one of my playlists, some of the songs will just shuffle into different places where i dont want them, the problem is worse when i try to reorder the songs to my liking, not only do the songs not reorder, but other songs will shuffle to other places on my playlist. Posted this review here because its annoying and I dont know if customer service is going to help me with this problem",4
"SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED. Fast forward button is limited to only 15 seconds! I wrongly assumed that this was to motivate subscribers to pay for premium but unfortunately, regardless of which type of account you hold, there is no remedy. Additionally, upgrading your account only gets rid of ads during music, NOT podcasts - I could understand if ads were at least kept to the beginning & end of episodes but nope. Ridiculous considering even Stitcher Radio & Audible offered multiple forwarding options.",1
"There needs to be a feature that will allow me to remove shuffle from the options, it keeps turning its self on and shuffling the playlist I'm listening to and I don't usually notice till I'm right in the middle of a chore and can't get to my phone to shut off shuffle and then I have to go through and try to find the last song on my list that I was listening to. I pay for premium so I don't get interrupted by ads so why would I want to get interrupted by songs I don't like.",1
"This used to be so much fun, but latest updates mean that I can no longer add the same song multiple times to a playlist for streaming. It also cuts songs off before they end properly. Hitting shuffle results in the same songs being played every day... if I wanted to listen to the same few songs on repeat, I'd listen to Heart FM.",2
"I've been a user for years but now spotify is ruined on mobile and desktop. Smart shuffle keeps breaking the song queue. UI has become way worse. I have some of my own mp3 files added to spotify from my desktop pc and you are able to download them for offline use on mobile but sometimes they just dont download anymore and when they finally do, it eventually bugs out and spotify cant play them anymore. I'm seriously considering moving to yt music or something.",1
"One of the worst music apps Ive ever had. No matter how updated everything is, it cuts off in the middle of songs and when I open the app again, the song is restarted. It also skips in the middle of songs like Im listening to a CD. I will listen to an ad for 30 minutes of music, it will play one song and them go back to 4 commercials before playing only 2 songs.",1
"Usually a great app, but going downhill fast like Amazon Music in the past few months. Android users have currently been dealing with a serious playlist order bug for over a week resulting from a development team fumble that Spotify has been allegedly investigating without any apparent solution offered, even after an additional app update. Not okay, especially after the recent increase in subscription dues. Doesn't seem like the right time to be laying off 17% of your employees.",2
"Love the app but dear God, I have thousands of songs added to playlists and downloaded and the app runs so painfully slow and now I try and launch the app and it won't even open. I've tried everything to fix it but nothings worked and now my only option is uninstalling the app and I don't want to do that since it will remove everything I've downloaded (which is close to i think 9,000 songs). Super disappointing cause this is my main way to listen to music and podcasts and now it won't even work",2
"I HATE that I pay for this app. The songs ""play"" but no music comes out half of the time. I can't switch songs easily if it's been playing in the background, and it also freezes constantly. It's super hard to add a song to a playlist if you've been listening for more than 15 minutes. 2024 update. Nothing ever loads. Can't add songs to my ""liked"" playlist anymore, randomly turns off and always turns off shuffle. The app continues to get worse every week.",1
"I have premium but recently the app has stopped letting me open my downloaded playlists/albums while offline. I literally cannot do anything but listen to whatever the last song I was listening to was when offline. Nothing seems to work, resetting cache, redownloading my playlists, even reinstalling the app does nothing. Not to mention smart shuffle randomly turning itself on, smart shuffle just is the worst feature in this app, it's really clunky.",1
"The app slows down once you download a large amount of media for offline play. At 58 gb, it just crashes and now I can't open Spotify at all. It really sucks that I can't have my music offline so I don't have to use (and pay for) data while away from wifi. I generally like Spotify and our duo plan, but the offline experience really sucks.",2
"A nightmare with adequate variety poor quality. As a user, I am harrased with incessant adds. The software is hard to navigate and there is little to no customization. They push an expensive premium plan down your throat. I switched to stitcher and then google podcasts, both great, but they are going away now. You can't even download unlimited podcast without premium.",1
"I can't believe anyone thinks this is a good app. It loops the same few songs infinitely, and plays censored versions occasionally. At this point I get 5-6 min of music followed by 3 minutes of ads. I tried premium, and it was a huge disappointment. Same problems, just no ads. The AI DJ certainly has Alzheimer's disease with it choices that are almost exclusively songs you had just hand picked, then repeats them over and over. Total garbage app.",1
"Used to be good, but then it decided to not auto play similar songs. Now it just loops one song for 5 hours unless user intervenes. I try to press the repeat button to make it stop, it only repeats album or repeats song. I can no longer just pick a song and let Spotify do the rest, I have to babysit. I'm not babysitting while driving. ""My Mix"" on YouTube now does better than Spotify.",1
"Good app, good style, everything is perfect. Only 1 complaint, doesn't have to be taken care it's fine, but how you have to pay premium to shuffle or sort songs in order on a playlist. Good app though, good luck👍🏻 (This edit was the day after posting this. I also don't like how when I listen to ""MY"" playlist, there are songs I didn't add that say, ""We added."" Don't like it but still good app.) (2nd edit: Now it's adding songs I don't want on ""MY"" playlist not giving me an option)",2
I've had Spotify premium for 8 years now and every year the home screen just gets more and more convoluted. I miss the old days of Spotify with simple UI and now I'm bombarded with random podcasts and music that has nothing to do with my preferences. The only redeeming thing about this app is they haven't raised prices.,3
"It's catalogue of music (like it's pc version) is by far the only reason to use Spotify. This is an overwhelmingly negative experience for anyone with even slight standards... Repetitive ads, of course, no option to add to queue, exclusively shuffle playing mode (except for a few songs you can play per day), you can't seek, can't download, ridiculously forced song suggestions they make you listen to, and only a few amount of skips a day... The entire app is just a ploy to get you to buy premium.",1
"I had a hard time deciding how many stars to give this. It's been a great experience for about a decade, but the last 2 years was bad. The app freezes, won't load, stops playing in the middle of the song, etc. I've tried everything to make it work and it won't. Very frustrating because I pay for premium so I can listen off line and it just won't work anymore!",3
Spotify used to be a awesome app.... I switched to Spotify from gaana... But now it has become the worst It's Very irritating.....the ads are still fine but now it doesn't allow us to skip the songs or forward the songs The songs cannot be played in a queue You've just got 6 skips per hour....you can play only one song of your own choice That's very disappointing fact about Spotify,1
"I have been using Spotify for years now and have had no major problems until recently. Suddenly, on Bluetooth, my music will just stop. Doesn't matter if I'm connected to earbuds, wireless speaker, or my car. I'll get 2-3 songs consistently and then nothing. I have to open my phone and go back to the app to continue playing my songs. Obviously this is an issue when I'm on the road and particularly on a bike. I'll have to spend most of my ride in silence.",3
"This app is great!... for the price. Interface is easy to use and the algorithm works wonder in suggestions. Bug with listening device selection was fixed so I gave it another star, but now I've realized that the ""hide this song"" from a specific playlist doesn't work. We need an incognito mode! Private session is annoying to activate, doesn't work with Google Home and it doesn't specify if it's the same as incognito.I listen to repetitive music for sleeping that I do not want it on my algorithm.",3
"Till I was a premium member there was no issue with app. The moment I become normal user they have restricted below features which are very basic to any app. 1. Fwd and Rev seeking of song is disabled. 2. Shuffle is disabled. 3. Looping and repeating the song is disabled. 4. Going back to previous track is not possible. 5. Even replaying the track is not possible, since previous track button itself disabled. If want to play that song again I need to go to playlist again select the song.",1
"Android automotive version is borderline unusable. Playlists don't sync, sorting songs or playlists doesn't exist. If you have the automotive version installed but try to make selections from the phone they don't always play in the car. I found entries in the Spotify support community where people report these issues. No resolution is provided but they are marked Solved. I'm about to uninstall the automotive version and just use Bluetooth. Do better, Spotify",1
"Why do you keep on removing all the basic features spotify. We didn't have any problems earlier even there were some ads in between. But it has become too annoying now. I can even play a song from specif part, too much ads in between songs, cannot add music to queue and lot more annoying things on the go. Its like we don't have any options if we don't go premium. Too much profit mentality from these guys. 👎👎👎",1
"Don't bother with this app unless you are willing to pay ten dollars a month. The free version has ads every other song and will start playing ""suggested"" songs instead of songs actually on your playlist. Even when I exit the app and reenter that specific playlist it will continue doing it. I want to listen to my playlist not random songs they want me to listen to. Its honestly a great music app with premium but otherwise it sucks.",1
"it's okay. The ads suck and take forever. Recently, it's been playing suggested songs that have absolutely nothing to do with me. The songs they play are not even in the same genre of music I listen to. It's been getting annoying. The only way to enjoy it is to pay for the premium. I want to listen to songs, not ads 24/7. I'm debating switching to a new way to listen to music. Edit: I understand yall need to make money. I'm okay with listening to 1 maybe 2 adds in a row but 5-6 is a bit much.",2
"The app doesn't open on tablet, it would open with a black screen almost all the time. It just can't be used. And it isn't that my operating system is old, because I have try it the latest android os and it would open with a black screen. I have being using YT music instead, and if spotify continues with the issue I might change to YT music because it's work wonderful and without problems.",1
"Twice now, I get a message that says I'll get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening after an ad. So I let the ad play, one song plays but then I get another ad. After only one 3 minute song, has not been 30 minutes. YouTube music free is better because I still get ads but at least I can choose what song I want to hear and YouTube music will play the song after the ad, whereas Spotify will not play the song I want to hear but put on a playlist of related songs",1
"I'm getting so mad, I used to not mind the ads because I didn't have premium but I always found them dumb. Anyways my real issue is I downloaded this app so I can listen to music with my phone non active or off but lately qhwnni turn it off my Spotify doesn't work and sometimes I don't because I know it won't work andy Spotify still goes of and all j want to do is listen to my music when I sleep. Please I'm begging you try to fix that because I am litterly about to download SoundCloud !!!!.",2
"No longer offers the option to download when not connected to WiFi. Fine most of the time, but occasionally I just want to switch that function on to quickly download something and then switch it off again. The app always suggests that it's possible to do, but it no longer appears in the settings menu. Update: response is that we can now only download via WiFi. This is a downgrade & also doesn't agree with what the app itself says. Suggest reinstate feature as there's no good reason to get rid.",1
"It's an awesome app of course but when you search up offline this is one of the top ones even though it's not offline, unless that's a premium option but ethier way if you have to pay to be able to use it offline than it shouldn't be an option when searching up offline. Anyways it's a good app but there's an ad every song and it even says ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening""...It lasted 5 minutes before getting an add, false advertising...Doesn't even let me exit app while playing music!!?",3
"You would think after 10 years, Spotify would fix this app always freezing at the 10 second mark but no. This app sucks when it doesn't work, which is 90% of the time. Edit: One of the most common ""solutions"" to this problem is to reinstall the app. This isn't a solution. This is a band-aid fix that temporary alleviates the issue but doesn't fix it. Spotify, it's been 10 years. You've had hundreds of people report this issue. Why is it so hard to fix this? Maybe Joe Rogan can fix it for you?",1
Considering no longer using Spotify. Used to love it because I hated the radio's habit of repeating a bunch a songs. Now Spotify is doing the same. Almost all my Playlists will take hours to get through and days for my saved songs but it repeats so much and if I pause for too long it resets my queue or plays songs I just listened to and added. It's getting increasingly annoying and needs to be fixed. I'm not paying to listen to the same 50 songs when I have over 2k downloaded.,2
"Love the app, though on occasions what is played is not something I am interested in. My complaint is storing the files on the card and then out of nowhere the files are in the main memory. Not wanted there. Do the move to card thing does not work. It says it does, it does not. Correcting means deleting , doing the options and then download again. I have suffered four times with this. This last time it was set to the card and then saved to main memory. Finger nowhere near the main memory",2
"The support staff for this app keeps non-sense making changes. The latest round makes the app friendly for 6 year olds, but wastes every adults time in navigating to desired content. They are forcing one album/Playlist to take up the entire real estate of your phone on the home screen. So you have to spend more than 30 seconds scrolling down to find what you're looking for. I've had a premium family plan for several years, but now I'm thinking of canceling and switching to another service.",2
"It ain't as good as it used to be. The app is far too restrictive, and instead of you being able to play the song of your choice the app plays an entire playlist instead. The only good part about this app is it lets you play with your screen off but that is it. It has gotten to a point where i'm considering paying for youtube music premium instead. PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS",2
"I've paid for family membership for years now. It used to be great but now after one or two songs the playlist suddenly stops. It was a pain that I could live with (just about). Now I can no longer cast music to any of my Google speakers at home which is the only way I listen to music, rendering my membership useless! Please fix ASAP.",1
"If you don't have premium you're better off going somewhere else for music. Six skips is absolutely insane and you can barely do anything on Spotify if you're not paying them directly. You can't choose your own songs, you only have six skips, the songs keep repeating despite it being on shuffle. I don't even hear half of my playlist. The ads are lies as well. ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" actually means, ""listen to two three minute songs and get another ad because you're poor""",1
"There's been a very recent and consistent issue that I've noticed other people have as well where when I open the app, it shows a blank slate with only two grey/black rectangles displaying where things should go, it loads for god knows how long and no matter how many times I close and reopen it, it doesn't work. I don't know what part of the update has caused it as this never happened before Update: It got worse, now it just never loads at all. I can't use the app",1
"Congrats!! Thanks to the option of atleast giving 1 star or u would prefer giving O. I mean ads and all are fine but what's the case with can't play songs on loop, can't go back to a song, can't choose shuffle in the correct order, can't navigate through the songs. And above all...I can't even skip more than 6 songs per hour. Spotify mixes two polar genres and now I can't even skip. Amazing!!!",1
"the service itself is good. but currently I have severe battery drain with the app. On my pixel 8, I'm losing about 6% every hour of listening to music in the background, and I normally listen 5+ hours a day. This doesn't seem to be an issue on any other device I own, but I wish Spotify could figure out what's going on sooner than later.",2
"Used to be good, total rubbish App now though, it cannot play a song without the music constantly dropping out, I get silence for about 5 seconds every 30 seconds or so, the song continues to play as far as the app is concerned. Reading through the reviews from the last few months there is obviously a lot of problems with this and everyone is simply being referred to customer service or told to reinstall etc (which I have done to no avail). The app needs fixed but this advice is ignored here",1
"It's the user interface and the lyrics seeking feature for me. One can use the lyrics to seek the music or drag the music to any part of the same song. I have never seen that on any music app. The user interface and theming as well are both awesome. Well done team Spotify! However, there's a feature I really need now. Please let each playlist have the memory of the last played song such that it continues from there or where the listener stopped upon clicking the play button on the playlist.",5
"Not intuitive. Too many missing features. I would pay twice as much for a better app. Unfortunately, Spotify is the best available; so 2 stars not being the worst. Years ago I used a piece of software called MediaMonkey; Spotify could learn a thing or two from MediaMonkey. I sometimes don't think Spotify remembers what business they're in.",2
"It has been lagging on my device recently, I mean it would just show the logo when I click on open and take minutes before actually opening to my songs and everything (Sometimes I even have to restart the app)... And whenever I connect to my airpods, it doesn't signify anymore unlike before thereby not giving controls using just my airpods and it sucks!.... Please work on it I actually love the app alot but this issue recently has been giving me doubts. Thanks",2
Spotify is a great place for me to find all the music I need however there are way to many adds and Spotify premium doesn't come with much of a benefit. There are promises of 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening after a short add. This is in fact fake. It was timed and you only get about 16 minutes after that add. Overall okay. Just hoping for less adds in the future.,3
"Last two updates have really messed my app up. Have to open it 2 or 3 times before it works consistently. Podcasts are glitchy and often black out the video.. hopefully they got a fix coming.. ..bout 3 years later fixed old bugs but plethora of news one. Most consistent and frustrating for me is the app will only play MAYBE 1-4 tracks then just not do anything. This is every single session. So far, it's been about 6 months of it. Very frustrating.",2
"I pay for a premium subscription. Unbelievable how bad it has become, not downloading songs, freezing, etc. Terrible. Was alright before, not anymore unfortunately. Also random songs in other languages are being added to my playlists. Spotify should stop messing my playlists and get rid of their terrible algorithms and make their app that works and works smoothly.",1
"It's an okay app, but if I could actually find single songs or edit my own playlists or even view what is in said playists WITHOUT premium, that would be great. And also, you know, being able to go back to a song that you just listened to would be nice. Also, it would have been great if I had been told I had three months of free premium before it started and ended.",3
"Amazing app for music! I don't have Spotify premium but, it's still good anyways. the only thing i don't like is that some songs (Cluster- Slipknot for example.) Don't show lyrics, even though it says it dose it'd just a gray screen when you click on it. Anyways love the app! So excited for the next update!! Edit: Spodify dosent open anymore. It's annoying >:(",3
"It was great, IN THE PAST. Then they started moving every single feature to premium, which I feel is completely senseless! Like the fact that you can't skip to a specific part, or atleast rearrange your album... AND WHY DO I GET ADS BETWEEN EVERY SINGLE SONG? Isn't that too much? Also I've been facing problems logging in recently... When I enter my credentials, it says ""account not found"", and when I try creating a new account with the same email ID, it says ""Account already exists""!!",1
"This is my first foray into a music streaming service, instead of listening to downloaded music on my phone. It was great- WAS. It has rapidly declined in quality in the last month or so. Doesn't matter if I'm on wifi or data, it'll crash. Yes, even on my home wifi. I have it set to the lowest quality, and it still crashes. It has crashed so much today that I'm finally rating it. If I pay for a premium service, I ought to be able to use it. ETA:I have reinstalled multiple times. It doesn't help",1
"The only reason I'm keeping this app is because of the Spotify original podcasts. Everything else is kinda sucky... sometimes offline mode doesn't want to work and often the app closes itself when I open other apps that don't even utilize sound. Also, there is a difference between downloading a song and adding a song to your favourites, Spotify just assumes if you download a song you want it in your favourites. Kindly do better.",1
This was the best app but now it's become the worst. I don't know why spotify is begging to take premium. We rewind or choose any part of the song to play. Moreover now we can play our playlist peacefully because of smart shuffle. Also we can't skip songs if we skip more than 6 songs. We can play a song once per day. Means if you play a song and then you want to play it again you can't. It says that you have to play it the next day.,1
"I've had Spotify for almost a decade and it has never been as bad as it is now. I'm a premium subscriber but it's getting bad enough I'm about to cancel and uninstall the app. After opening the app it takes at least 5 minutes for the song I selected to play, whether it's downloaded or not. It's recently rearranged my playlists which is very irritating. Shuffle is now required to be on which I do not like. Ir also will occasionally just crash. Songs also take forever to play if selected at random",1
"Since the last update, the app has had this stupid glitch were it will switch the first song in your playlist with another random one in the same playlist, and there is no fixing it. It is so annoying! When I go on my computer it's fine, there is no swap of songs in the playlist but it is so frustrating in the app",1
Annoying. I never use this app but I'm just trying to listen to the new ye album. The UI makes no sense and I've only listened to like 3 of his songs before it started playing songs from his old albums. The only other way I could scroll through the songs is listening to like 30 second previews of it. Like I don't get it,1
"Convenient, but no superstar. Pandora and YouTube are where I discover more new music, and sometimes Spotify doesn't have the songs I am looking for. Their algorithms just pump the same songs in my ears to the point where I get sick of them too soon... Update. I use Spotify as my primary source of music collection and am discovering some new music and some features have improved but they still are slow to add simple features. Recommendations for playlists are rarely songs I hadn't considered.",4
"App behaves in bizarre and unpredictable ways. Its like AI run amuck. Shuffles playlists when shuffle isnt on, plays songs not even in the playlist, and will play non-downloaded songs when not on wifi, even though that feature is turned off. The chat support function is supremely frustrating and impossible to find...why is it not built into the app? If Spotify's response here is to contact them directly...sure, but how about you make it easy to do so first? Its like you dont really want us to.",1
I like the before version of spotify more where you can play your music with your own sequence. I have been using Spotify more than 2 years. It's quit Irritating when you can't backward the music or play a specific part of the music. Please do something about this issue for non premium users. Thank you.,1
"I've been having a similar problem to the other reviews I've seen, my playlists don't stay in the order I put them in. I've also been having problems with playing my playlists in general, I'll be listening to them (with premium) and it'll start playing songs that aren't in there? It happens even when I have smart shuffle off. Spotify has just been acting wonky recently, and I'm kinda confused.",4
"New update still plays hidden music. I use set playlists that were made by other listeners and/or Spotify themselves. I would ""hide"" music that I did not enjoy from the playlist and continue listening. In the past, Spotify would skip the hidden songs, but after the update, it just continues playing them. What's the point of the ""hidden"" feature if nothing changes the overall experience ?",3
Experience breaks down with large playlists. The shuffle doesn't work or loops the same set of songs in large playlists. Shuffle is often in the exact same order as well. Also why can't I reverse sort my likes? I want to listen to my old music sometimes and it should be easier to do so. But I've been using this app for years so I'm stuck with the bad.,2
"Every update brings a new set of issues. Currently it's a podcast issue. When I finish an episode , instead of playing the next episode it reverts back to a previously played episode . It does this every time , meaning I have to manually select the best unplayed episode. Really frustrating when driving as I have to pull over to fix issue",2
"Many times the same issue. Device with Spotify app is connected with the Bluetooth speaker but music doesn't out from the speaker. That's really annoying!!! I think I did wrong with switching Amazon music to Spotify Update. I've been contacted with ""customer service"", but it was a damn bot!!!!! What an insult to all Spotify users🤬",1
"Recently, the songs on my playlists keep getting mixed up, like a random song gets moved to the top. I have them in the order I want! I do not use shuffle. If that's not fixed soon, I'm out. I also agree that they are adding too many new features that are making the app worse. Don't fix what isn't broken!!!",1
"love spotify but i keep having trouble, still am after reinstalling. i only have wav, m4a, mp3 files saved for spotify, and i dont understand why theyre not working when i have storage access for the app. adding on, recently Ive been getting ads after EVERY single song. it's really annoying, as i used to only get them after 2-3 songs. when i listen to ANY of my playlists, i expect to listen to every song, but instead only a few selected songs actually play, and the others rarely do. fix ur app.",1
"it's great pretty much perfect as can be, but can you bring the heart feature back? I like the new thing, it's easier to add to songs to playlists, but it's a bit of an inconvenience to press the ""Add to Playlist"" button to add/remove a song to my liked songs. maybe integrate both onto the song page? please and thank you - coming from a premium and paying customer",4
"So, whenever you want to play a song, a different song pops up. And u have to listen to that song until it's over for it to play the song you chose. Plus, sometimes, u get 3-5 different songs you have to listen to before you can listen to the song you chose. So other than that, this app is not great, but it's good. I recommend that u use YouTube or something like that...so lol",3
"There's a glitch!!! It's moving a song from the middle of a Playlist to the very top and no matter what you do it won't fix it, it messes the entire Playlist up when you let the songs run to the end of the Playlist then back to the start, then it just freaks out and plays something random. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!",1
"I was loving the app, I really hate the smart shuffle option. I'm not sure if it turns back on after I switch it off or I just doesn't just doesn't shut off. It throws random songs in that I don't like. Also it will throw songs in random places. like if I have a few albums on the same list a song that belongs on one album is found in the middle of another album. Example Taylor swifts song Fearless is mixed in Ed Sheerans × album",3
"Honestly Spotify was on of the best apps I used for listening to music but now it's not, it doesn't show the lyrics, lots and lots of adds, and I have limited chances to listening to music I don't understand where this came from and I'm not going to premium just to listen to music. I'm just saying they should fix that because they will lose a lot of listeners",3
"My playlists are rearranging themselves. And as someone with autism, my songs playing in a specific order is important. So when songs are completely mixed up and the app refuses to let me put them back in their proper place it's very infuriating and stressful. I try putting the song back to the spot I like it and different song just boots itself up to the top of the playlist, I hate it so much.",1
"I've been paying for the duo plan for about 2 years or more now, and I've been having an issue with spotify crashing randomly, if it does decide to open at all. Ive also had an issue with my postcasts re-starting after getting to about the middle of the episode. On top of that, I can't get my downloaded music to play or itll stop to load 3-4 times. These problems are a little annoying especially considering how much I pay a month for these features to not work.",3
"When listening to Spotify in the car on a Samsung S22 Ultra connected via Bluetooth the app seems to close randomly (consistently) and the music turns off. You then have to open your phone and reopen the Spotify app to continue playing - which only lasts a few songs before closing again. This happens in 3 different cars that I use and it also happens on my partner's phone (also Samsung S22 Ultra). Very frustrating and makes listening to the app pointless in the car. App up to date, phone restart",2
"premium user here: the state of Spotify has been going way downhill since I started using it. as an android user with an extremely limited data plan, Spotify manages to eat up my GBs without fail every month, even though I only listen to my downloaded songs and download over wifi. I blame the immense amount of autoplaying short videos that seem to be everywhere on the app. another issue that has recently popped up is the insanely frequent undownloading of my entire library. fix your app spotity.",1
"It has plenty of music and the premium student is not that expensive which is quite cool but PLEASE do something about the problems everybody is talking about ! One time out of two spotify won't open, I have to uninstall it EVERYTIME of my samsung tab s7 in order for it to work. Otherwise I've got a black screen with nothing charging even after closing the app. Could you please fix this. It is annoying and it ruins the experience.",2
"Is there a reason why no matter how many times I transfer my downloads to the SD card, they end up being deleted a few days later and everytime I try to download them back, it's always to the internal storage? I'm getting real sick of that. Currently I have my storage set to SD card, and for some reason app data is accumulating as if it was being sent to the internal storage, even though I clearly have it set to the SD card. Please fix this!!!",2
"Spotify app worked flawlessly with my vehicles up until Spotify's last update 6 days ago. Now, it does not even play with android auto. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app results in the same lack of performance. It plays on my s23 ultra as intended through the car, just has that black screen on the display of the vehicles with no control via the vehicle. Only way is via phone. Please take it back to classroom instruction so it too can play well with android auto again during recess.",2
"Fpr at least a year or two, the app has become VERY annoying to use for downloaded podcasts. It very frequently pauses, and will jump back anywhere from several seconds to several minutes, when I resume play. Constant updates have done nothing to address it. This is all the occuring on a flagship Android phone.",2
"Only Spotify can lie about your internet status every time you open it, lie about being able to play anything offline let alone open the app, actively and regularly gets rid of songs you have on repeat, shows you those songs in a top 50 (only on pc) and lie about 20% of em ever being in your likes or any Playlist ever and still expects a pat on the back for adding buggy features no one asked for or actively avoids using. Thanks Spotify another job well done as usual",1
"Hello, I've been listening to spotify for a bit, and I listen without spotify premium. When I listen to my songs, I don't even get to listen to 5 or 4 without having like 5 long adds interrupt me. I get that you need premium to not have any ads, but I think you put too many ads after a very short period of listening. So if you could please change that. Thank you.",2
"honestly, the only issue I have with this app is that sometimes when you're playing the music in the background and open another app, even if the other app is not playing sound, Spotfiy eill stop playing in the background and you have to go back into the app in order to unpause your music. And this only happens on mobile. I don't know if it does this for other people as well, but it's really frustrating, y'know what I mean?",4
"Been a paid member for a long time, but a recent change, or maybe a bug, is absolutely ruining the experience - I can't add individual local files songs to queue and it's driving me insane since I've been able to do this from start. It's like an essential function I love just got removed.",3
"Smart Shuffle turns on randomly without my permission. I think it's a cool feature and probably quite useful for a lot of people. Personally, however, I prefer not to use it. I'm giving this update one star. Not only is it annoying for me to have to turn the feature off twice a day or more, but under no circumstances is it okay for it to turn on without my consent. It If it's a bug, it needs to be fixed and if it's a design choice it needs to be seriously reconsidered. All the best, Juan",1
"Please fix the playlist reordering bug! Driving me absolutely bonkers when I've spent so long getting a playlist perfectly curated, my dudes. Yes, I have the playlist set to Custom order, and I'm a Premium subscriber (because the ads and no skip was a horror show). 200+ hours of absolute bangers, designed for optimal listening of completely clashing genres: there WAS a vibe, and you've absolutely trainwrecked it, Spotify.",1
This app used to be the go to music streaming. These days this app is basically useless I have this issue every time that I load the app up where it will start playing whatever it wants to be it a playlist or a different song sometimes it will interrupt me mid-song and switch to whatever it feels like. If I'm listening to something else and I pause it and I come back to it a few minutes later when I go to unpause the song it'll change it. the customer service is useless I spoke to 4 folks nohelp,1
"I pay for premium so I don't have to deal with ads, but now they have a new feature where in-app marketing banners for concerts will appear on nearly every page you navigate to, that you are unable to opt out off at all. There's also no ability to remove recommend podcast episodes even tho I've never listened to a podcast a day in my life. My homepage should just be recommendations based off of what I actually listen to. Seriously considering moving to another platform.",1
Overall a good app but I did have a problem with the playlists. I have my songs in one of my playlists organized the way I want them and the first song kept switching with different songs in the playlists. I dont know if this is just my phone not working or what but I really need it to stop.Also when I have spotify open playing something and try to open another app it just takes me back to spotify and pauses the song.I would also like to download the lyrics.But other than that great app. -Milo🤘,4
Please please PLEASE enable 'not interested' or 'do not show again' button for suggested podcasts especially. It's been years since spotify exist but you don't have this function??How is it impossible to customize our own homepage for this app when we can easily choose what we want to see and hear on other apps??? Fix this soon or I'm not gonna bother keeping the app anymore.,1
"This app is very buggy and a pain to use. It crashes after every commercial, sometimes I have to restart the app multiple times before I can get it to play the podcast again. It sucks that this is the only place I can get Rogan's podcast, this is the worst podcast platform I have used yet. Addendum 1/27/24: I now have to constantly delete and reinstall the app in order to listen to my podcasts. Constantly failing.",1
I don't understand why Spotify makes it so difficult for music not to automatically play via Bluetooth when you get in the car. I understand that engineers think that everyone once everything to connect seamlessly.... Music isn't one of them. Did the engineers ever stop and think that people should be giving a clear choice on whether the should start playing automatically. What happened to choice? Or is that not a thing anymore?,2
"I'm not happy due to the fact that my playlists do not stay in the order I put them together. Songs are now in totally random order, and even if I try to edit them back to the way I had them, they go back to some random order. Seriously, considering canceling Spotify Premium and giving another streaming service a try, one that will not mess with my playlists",2
Yal are falling behind as a customer and investor I am telling you that you are becoming pandora. Idk why music always seems to disappear on here but its starting to get annoying. And some of the music that isnt available is making apple music and youtube music seem way more appealing. Cant even keep a consistent playlist on this platform. Also why all of a sudden my private Playlist keep getting changed at random and I can't edit my own Playlist order how I prefer. This update needs an update.,2
"Your are ruining the whole music experience with advertising way too much, I listen to one song and then next two ads. One can't have that good feeling of a song or continue to flow on that, well may be if that's how you to plan getting users to buy your premium service's, it sucks! If you are Spotify premium user, and switched to a free plan. It's pure chaos, because the platform tries in all the ways possible to get you back on premium plan, doesn't allow you to play songs in a list.",1
"I have been using spotify for a few years now and it always got the job done, but after the recent update custom playlists have become bugged when it comes to having songs in a custom order. Shuffle has also been buggy for awhile now especially for large playlists, it shuffles the same set of songs instead of the whole playlist. Local files across devices also sometimes does not track correctly. Really hope yall fix the app fr.",2
"Very good on my Pixel 6 Pro but near unusable on my Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra. With the latter, the app constantly complains it doesn't have permission to play in the background, but in the settings, there isn't a permission it doesn't have. Consequently, I am lucky to get two tracks out of the app before it seizes up. I don't get this with Amazon music or YouTube music.",3
Used to be better. It's sometimes very slow when opening the app and playing a song and it's not my internet. I just used the DJ AI by accident and it broke the app so bad I had to delete it and re-download 25GB+ worth of music. It kept crashing whenever I tried to play a song. Now I go to pin some playlists to the top and get a message saying ONLY 4 PINS ALLOWED. Why? Ridiculous. Even worse is that I only have 3 pins... I'm real close to finding an alternative app and canceling act.,1
"Spotify feels very unoptimized overall, but that is very apparent when browsing through the playlists related to Podcasts: choppy scrolling; delay to start downloads; I've had the app taking ~30sec to realize I had an internet connection, where I could not play any of the podcasts I had *downloaded* (this is the most annoying. the time taken varies); I open the app ""just to search for one song"", and end up waiting like 10sec for the search to resolve. I use a note 10 lite, not a 7yr old phone.",2
Listening to Local Files on phone is really terrible. I have a lot of Local Files on my Pc Spotify because some songs are not on Spotify. I put those in playlists and download the playlist on my phone. That way I can listen to Local Files on my phone when I'm not at home. The problem is the Local File songs on my phone very often become unavailable and I have to remove and redownload all songs again. Fix is only temporary. They especially don't work when I change the icon of the mp3 file on PC.,3
"Spotify continues to find ways to make their UI worse. Now when you connect a bluetooth headset, Spotify places a ""For You"" section in your notification bar and on your lock screen. Interacting with it usually does nothing, which is somehow preferred. If it does work, Spotify will start playing content you probably weren't opening the app to listen to. Yes, Spotify really introduced a feature that gives users a better experience when it doesn't work. I can't wait for this company to die.",1
"Can someone please explain how the biggest music streaming app has the worst shuffle function known to man? I have heard people complain about this but never understood until recently. I have lots of playlists with hundreds of songs in it, and I love listening to them all at random. But I can not do that with this service. For whatever reason, Spotify will play my most recently added or listened to songs within that playlist first? I could just listen to my liked songs in order if I wanted that.",1
"2/2/2024 ""30 minutes of ad free music"" is a LIE! Useless app! I spend hours creating a Playlist and when I play it plays random stupid songs most having NO connection. Not a single song from my actual Playlist. Why even let you make a list if they won't pay those songs? Don't EVER pay for premium! If you ever cancel they will spam you with all the ads you avoided during the free trial. I'm not paying $10 a month for Music that I never own.",1
"Great app, been using it for years now across multiple platforms, however recently when I started listening to music on the Console version (PlayStation) and my Smart TV I find it kinda annoying that there's no playlist sorting option, which makes it a little annoying trying to select the most recent added track of a playlist, especially if it's a long one, would be cool if you could add this feature. Thanks.",4
"I think this app is pretty good, but when you have an advertisement you don't like or like you can either put a thumbs up or down and state your reasoning. One of the advertisements on here I find offensive and I have put a thumbs down multiple times on my phone, but everytime I play music the advertisement will still play. This applies to advertisements that also keep show up more on your phone. Also when your offline, you need to pay for premium just to listen to music. I",4
I love the service and what it offers but sound quality wise compared to apple it is horrible. I don't know what people are talking about maybe it's the other features that it offers as I said which are great but it literally gave me a headache I thought my Bluetooth speaker was broken. I will keep my account and continue to use things like podcast but as far as my streaming music service it's a no-go unfortunately,3
"10.02.2024. This app used to be amazing, up until about 6 months ago. First they messed with the algorithms so now my shuffle liked songs just pushes my most recently liked songs and recently released songs to the front (I see what you're doing 💰). I have 15k liked songs and want to hear ALL of them, not just the most recent ones. Even more recently, I'm having serious performance issues. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It wasn't broke, take this app back to what it was September 2023.",2
"Spotify has seriously gone downhill since they started pushing every playlist to be AI generated 'For You.' This has simply had the reverse effect of making discovery worse and it much harder to find music outside your top played artists. E.g.- playlist 'Classic Punk' starts playing the Foo Fighters. 'World Music' kicks off with Red Hot Chili Peppers. Playlists that were solely based on genre/mood are now all 'For You.' On top of that, Discover Weekly is not what it used to be. What garbage..",1
"(premium user) i HONESTLY love this app, every feature, interface is user friendly but but the only problem am facing recently is that they don't show the lyrics. it might be available in phone but if you look for them in pc then it goes along the lines 'not available....couldn't load'. it's seriously getting frustrating at this point, if even after paying for premium the app is proving useless i have no choice but to cancel the subscription.",3
"One issue: When I put songs in the queue, i dont know why but if the queue is put while online then go offline, it makes the app hella slow and sorta timeout, bringing the 'Something went wrong' error. Worst thing is once you go online, the queue will only have the first song and cannot change. The song will play out and then the timer exceeds the song duration. Its happened from yesterday and the timer exceed issue only happened today. It sucks tbh. Please help",3
"what could cause my playlist to be grabbing random songs from the middle and sticking them at the top? I restarted device, I uninstalled and reinstalled which did nothing but remove my nearly 20gb of audio that I now have to re-download. i see others with the same ridiculous glitch, and the best part is if you try to edit and fix the playlist at all, it starts to spaz out and randomly rearrange more songs. how?",1
"I have be a heavy user of the premium version of this app for 4+ years and in the last 6 months the quality of this app has dropped SIGNIFICANTLY! I do not recommend this app. Look elsewhere. There are numerous bugs that were the same on two different phones, and I am reasonably sure everything is configured right on my end. Lately the downloads and offline functionality is terrible. it deleteds playlists I make offline, I find that it can't access albums that it showed downloaded, and much more",2
Amazing it was so easy to set up and has all my favorites after one time of searching it and had for some reason i would put on a song and it would play a different song and was total luck if I got the song I wanted. In other words a lot was right and I saw little wrong. Keep it up Spotify. PS. I'm listening to Spotify while filling this out.,4
"Starting off by saying the greatest music app. No debate. Very fine n abstract illustrations. Love the wrapped and statistical features, apparently no other app offers it as far as I've experienced. Many songs are available, literally every song.BUT I have mixed feelings for this app. BECAUSE you can't execute basic features like look,queue and rewind or even scrub which is selfish. The charts will increase like crazy without it but also there'll be no meaning of premium. {pretty cool 2 xplore}",3
"Can't believe they got rid of the dislike/hide button in the swipe down notification panel. Smooth brain move. Randomly disconnecting from phone when playing over Google home speakers. Hiding a song in release radar doesn't auto skip to the next track. When you skip manually, the app skips 2 songs ahead. Super dumb and annoying. Now when I open the app and go into release radar or disco weekly it defaults to the middle of the playlist and won't start over when it ends.",1
Is this current version sort of joke ?!! Main playlist which is 50 hours long is now playing songs according to some random queue I didn't select and can't undo without selecting each song individually Like the playlist is stuck on shuffle without the icon being highlighted What's the point in creating your own playlist if the queue is just going to override it anyway ?!! Ridiculous !!!,1
"I'm so poor, so imma give a real review. I will never delete Spotify, even the free version. However, if u have the free version, the shuffle only goes so far. I believe Spotify psychologically manipulates potential customers into purchasing premiums - which obviously premium would accommodate best. BUT the free version plays too many repeats. I have 2, 4, 8, & 16 hours plus playlists, and I hear repeats on every playlist I have. At least shuffle each playlist w no repeats. What a tactic 👉. 😩",3
"Woke up to find Spotify has changed the order of my playlist, displaying a random song at the top rather than the one that's supposed to be there. It has also undownloaded all of my downloaded songs by itself even though my device has plenty of space. What the hell am I paying for? Has there been a recent update that has caused this? Stop messing with the app. If it isn't broke, don't fix it!",2
"I really hate that just for you can pick just one song you like you have to literally get Spotify premium like that's so stupid and when you get ""30 minutes of uninterrupted music"" after Like 2 song a ad pops up like that just makes me so annoyed. And when I put a song on my Playlist I can't listen to it this app is terrible. They should definitely fix this or it's not going to be usable. And maybe let people listen to there songs without premium! Fix your appp",1
"Without premium, it's the worst. You have to watch ads that can't be skipped that interupt your flow, you can make a limited amount of playlists, and even can't remove recommendations and skip more than three songs. You could easily argue that it's made for premium. With premium, you can background play, you can find every single song, some that are not even in YouTube.",3
"It's the best app for music, in my opinion. But of course there are some bad things too. Like, when I look for a song and try to play it, before I actually find the song a lot of others songs show up and sometimes I don't even have enough skips to get to the song I wanna hear, so at the end I don't hear it at all. There are a lot of other problems but I can't say it all in here because it won't fit, but please make it more simple for those who don't have premium to listen to music on this app.",4
"Using Version 8.9.8.545 of this app on my phone. There's a bug in it. On my other devices, the songs in my playlist were arranged the way I wanted it. In my phone, the app keeps pulling up one or two songs in the middle of the playlist and puts it on the top. I tried to sync my playlist from my computer to my phone but the app would keep one or two songs out of line. It refuses to sync with the same playlist in my computer. I'm getting frustrated and might want to switch to another service.",1
"Update: the app is still wildly buggy. Plays random podcasts in your history instead of the selected one. Will stop playing music randomly and throw an Internet connection issue when no other apps have issues conne Offers a ""listen to this ad for 30mins of advertisement free"" ... Then proceeds to play an ad every 8mins. I feel like every time Spotify sucks me back into a pair subscription, it just as quickly reminds me to find another music app. The paid functions rarely work (queue this time).",1
"It was good at the beging. But updates this app is going on crazy. I can't even forward or backward the song play. Many times the app gets hanged.Sometimes the songs which are need to be played willnt be played. Instead some other song from any playlist or liked song will be play.Repeated ads irritates too much. ""IT WAS BETTER IN BEGINNING.""",1
"How do you ruin a shuffle button in a music app. This is a basic function, no one asked for this to change to a worse feature. This is worse than taking away the headphones jack from phones. I can't fathom why anyone would make a playlist, and decide to use a shuffle button that ads in music they didn't want. If anything, add ability to toggle it. Imagine not testing a ""feature"" and launching it to all users in a state that breaks normal functions. What's next shuffle pause? You got one week",1
"They are perfectly happy that my app hasn't worked correctly for over 2 months. Dozens of hours in the support lines made no difference, they escalated it to the highest troubleshooting authority and after a month of no progress being made, they still just don't care and want me to keep the subscription like nothing is wrong. Spotify was a once great company that just doesn't care about anything anymore. I recommend any other service over spotify.",1
"Smart shuffle is EASILY the worst addition to this app. Turns on at random, and then I have to completely close the app to undo this. Just a heads up, I will NEVER use this feature, I shouldn't be forced to, after paying to listen to MY playlist. Of course, that's if the playlist actually works properly. I created a playlist and have attempted to set the order I want the songs to play in. However, even after restarting my phone AND uninstalling I STILL can't complete this action. App sucks now.",1
"I would love to give it 5 stars, but I'm quickly learning that I miss certain things about Pandora that Spotify doesn't do or have. I would like to choose a specific artist or genre and have it auto play for me instead of simply giving me a list of Playlists that I have to choose from. I like the options, but if Spotify could have an autoplay option, 5 stars would definitely be my review.",4
"It was great... at first. I had been listening to my songs without ads, they were in a row where I could play them back, and I could even shuffle them. After some time, however, all of that changed. I got ads by the billions, and I cant even select which song I want to listen to on the playlists. This was a big letdown, and I'm definitely not using it without premium. It would be fine, but its crazy, the amount of stuff you have to go through just to listen to one song. Pay to win, this life is.",1
"What used to be a productivity app, is now a source of grief for an unforseen drug abuse and addiction! Well not really, Spotify used to be a great app, but maybe it offered too much, now all of that gone. Day after day it crashes 10+times per day, nothing but an absolute waste of time and energy. The Spotify today is no longer the Spotify we used to have.",1
"The only reason I used spotify for, isn't valid anymore. I loved Spotify because of it's flexibility. Now, you can't even go back to your song without a premium subscription, and that is really irritating. Just because you want to hear a line again, you now have to hear the song again, altogether. It is very disappointing.",1
"If they would fix the issue where the app would stop randomly opening up to songs i dont want to hear or just randomly changing the song i have playing and automatically shuffling songs i dont want, that'd be great. Also, the automatic recommended song playlist is not welcome at all 99% of the time, its songs i dont want to hear. App used to be great before all this bs. Paying for premium and getting all these issues is really making it not worth it anymore",1
Great for music but the constant adverts on podcasts when I have a premium sub are infuriating so I will not be renewing my subscription. Get ninety percent through an audiobook then it says you are out of time. Another scam to get more money off you & constantly pauses when playing . What's the point in downloading songs if you can't listen without internet?Without a sub postcode lottery ads are the most annoying thing in the world. Is this the plan to try and force people to subscribe?,1
"Sometimes when I search a song, it shows 100 other songs that aren't what I looked for, but displays the exact same name and image. I also can't look in playlists?? It is permanently on shuffle?? Also it crashes SO MUCH. You'll be better off searching the song names on YouTube then downloading this. TLDR: Clunky, Glitchy, Confusing, mess of poor choices.",1
Lowering stars to two. It was perfect. The UI is amazing but I can't get over the shuffle. It plays the same exact songs. Once it figures out you like listening to certain ones and it's like 10 different songs that I listen to every like 4 hours and I had to create an entire new playlist so it would stop playing the same songs I've been listening to for years,2
"It was a great app at the starting but later on it just became annoying. I can't even choose songs now. It's just irritating. I know Spotify wants money and so does this so that people would take a premium but if this keeps going on then people would rather Uninstall the app all along. I hope that Spotify fix this and not always focus or let's say force people to take a premium. Overall the app is super great, I recommend my friends too thus and they loved it",1
Have a premium family account also have it installed in my car as an app which worked well until just before Christmas. Doesn't work at all now in the car. It just spins. Tried uninstall and reinstall to no avail. Fed up now. Thinking about cancelling and moving to something else. Very poor that we've waited months for a fix for this.,1
"Android application is designed such that it is impossible to play ALL of an artist's music (i.e., all albums). It is only possible to play their ""top songs"", which only plays maybe the same 25 - 50 songs every time. This is an extremely basic capability that should not be missing from a premium, paid music streaming application. The ""shuffle"" algorithm is flawed. I hear the same songs repeatedly when listening to a playlist with several thousand songs and songs are clustered by artist name.",2
"When will you fix the buggy tizen galaxy watch app that is unusable? Cant see music playlists in menu Can only see search and settings. Most off the time music downloaded won't play Edit: waste of time...spoke to a ""call centre"" for over an hour. First person abandoned the chat after 30mins and gave up. Second one not much better. Both typical try turning it off and back on again Read the ratings in galaxy store then say all that's needed. Issues not fixed years later. Watch is unusable now",1
Spotify free is genuinely awful. I LOVE getting ads after every 2 songs or sometimes after every song. Really? You're going to shove advertisements down my throat to try and influence me to buy premium? And the ads themselves are just annoying and awful. Disliking them does nothing to change them so why even have the option to dislike them? To make me think I actually have a choice in the matter?Free shuffle is horrendous and plays the same songs every time. I'm going back to using cds.,1
Out of nowhere my Playlist was changed and every time I try to put it back tot he order I had it it put different songs on the top and moves other songs around. I have premium and this shouldn't happen I should be able to listen to the music in the order I put it in and not deal with it randomly being put in different orders on a custom made playlist!!!! They need to fix this asap!,1
"I used to love this app so much but now it has been very irritating. After every few songs you have to listen to adds about UPGRADING TO PREMIUM, when I DO NOT WANT TO. Recently I have been facing some more problems, I went to spotify to listen to some music and everytime I wanted to play a specific song it would show me the pop up of EXPLORE PREMIUM. I can listen to the adds but the app isn't even allowing me listen music now.",1
It's free experience is very bad. It just want to frustrate us so hard that we would rather buy it premium or just just quit using it . Earlier ads were okay as we get it we have to pay to listen add free music but now we can't even choose what we want to listen. I had now prefer to use YouTube to listen music as we can play whatever music at whatever time by only seeing ads which are also on Spotify,1
The app itself is pretty good if you can afford to buy the premium however recently in one of the more recent updates it tends to shuffle your playlists even if you turn it off before playing the song. This is especially annoying when it goes to the next song and trying to go back to turn off shuffle causes the song to stop playing the only information online about this is if an alarm uses Spotify but I have used the same alarm app for years with no issues and it doesn't connect to Spotify,3
I loved this app so much but now it has become painful listening songs on spotify.I can't swipe songs backward or forward.In addition to that it keeps stopping again and again in a single song and after restarting the song starts from the beginning everytime.....Oh So PATHETIC...😔Please fix the problems....I don't want to lose my beautiful playlists that I've made for myself throughout all these years...,1
"lately, whenever I'm listening to a playlist on my phone, the whole app will reload and the music will stop playing. On my TV too, the ads cut through the music before it's done playing and it's become very annoying. I love Spotify but I want to enjoy my day without these types of interruptions. Thank you.",3
"I hate this app so much now, I used to listen to spotify everytime but now I hate way too much. I cannot reverse the song, the reverse button is now closed. And no option for playing one song on repeat. I cant even listen to a particular part of any song, no matter what, if I want to listen to any part again I'll have to start over again with the song. I even tired to update it but no change.I hate this app so much now😤. It's the same thing again even after I have updated it 2 times.🤬",1
"Downloaded music doesn't always work when offline and there is sometimes just an endless loading screen. Album art also always loads in slowly when scrolling though my library, so all in all a bad experience. Looking online, there are loads of forum posts regarding these issues dating back years, but still no fixes. Do not recommend.",1
"🤔 Well the Aldi spam stopped but not it will cut in the middle of a song and then play recommended songs in genres I don't care for. I'm an old genx, I love what I love. It's annoying as hell that the app will suddenly stop Tool or Nirvana to play something from today's artists that I can't even remember the names of. On top of still making me listen to commercials it still won't let me hear what I like hearing. Unfortunately its better than apple.",1
"The fact that this is the only app I pay for is what makes this issue more frustrating. I'm unable to change the order of the songs in my playlist. I move one song to the top, and it randomly moves another song in front. The more I try to adjust the order, the worse it gets. If I wanted it to be random, I would just use shuffle.",2
"I had this app for 2 months and just recently I can no longer choose the songs I want to listen to in my playlist During the 2 months I had no ads and now it's after every song Now I just use YouTube I tried it again, because my friends use it, but now this app won't even play the music I like, I have 18 songs in a playlist, it plays like maybe 4, then it plays the worst music k own to mankind",1
"After I last updated this app, I was immediately flooded with ads once I opened this app. Still, a wave of ads splash over me everytime I open the app. After every song, ads pop up. Twice I got 6 ads in a row after playing a song. Once an ad popped up in the middle of a song playing and after that ad, it gifted me with 30 minutes of listening. More like 30 minutes of listening to ads. Not even 5 minutes, 2 ads pops up. In summary, THE ADS SUCK. And oh boy, that is not all.",2
"The new + feature sucks. When I go into my liked songs list and search for artists like Jazmine Sullivan I get no results, where if I go through normal search it says that the song is already in my liked songs playlist. Also my daily drive has been playing the same songs over and over again. I've tried listening to different songs and emptying my cache but it's not working. Algorithms always suck.",2
"Price went up for premium, possibly because of audio book inclusion? That was fine until I found out you're limited in the number of hours you can stream an audiobook. That's nowhere in the app itself, had to track down the info on the Google Play page. Odd you have to pay extra to finish a book that's over 15 hours or wait until next month, AND you can't ""top up"" in the app itself. Sounds like there's more advertising in free version, and they email about Duo even if you pay. Ease up on ads?",4
"I totally get that Spotify wants people to buy the premium. But do they really have to force us to do so? You can't just put a paywall on everything, that's like charging a classmate when they ask to borrow an extra pen. We can't choose the next song, we can't skip, we can't rewind, we can't listen to playlists/albums in order. If they're going to make the free plan so limited, why make it at all? Spotify, if you want your precious users, give them some reason to get your app in the first place.",1
"The app was actually fine but once I came back to my home country in Central Asia, after a while I realised that podcasts are not available here and I'm paying full price, which is quite expensive in local money for just music and not really user-friendly features. I'm really disappointed with this fact and definitely cancelling my subscription.",1
"Would give zero if i could. Used to be great however now this app is terrible. Constantly keeps turning on smart shuffle and I have to keep turning it off. I hate smart shuffle. I don't want songs I didn't pick to be on my playlist, ON MY PLAYLIST. NO OPTION TO GET RID OF IT. Keeps saying I am offline and none of my playlists load when I have perfect reception and all other apps that require internet are fine. Its glitchy as hell and stupidly made now.",1
"Spotify, please fix this. Everytime I listen to a song, it pauses at random times when I'm another app. and when I go back to check, the song is restarted! sometimes Spotify just stops responding for like ten minutes. it always say ""Spotify is not responding, close app or wait"" and on the app sometimes, THERES NOTHING!! just a grey screen with no song, no menu or anything but just a grey screen. IT'S SO ANNOYING! have Spotify premium and it's pretty good but FIX YOUR APP!!!!",1
"PROS: spotify allows you to create your own playlists, follow artists, favorite other playlists, and created blended playlists with your music and your friends' music. CONS: the amount of ads in this app is absurd. you have to watch two 30-second ads every few songs, and it didn't used to be two. it would also be nice to be able to shut off the shuffle feature on phones like you can on computers. also, there should be an unlimited amount of skips, not just 6. overall, this app could be improved.",3
"I love this app! Music is my lifeblood, and I spend most of my time listening to or looking for new music. This app has made this so much easier and more enjoyable. Although, I would adjust the user interface a little and make a few changes to the categorization and other small things. Regardless, it is a highly recognized app for a reason.",5
"Stopped working on my Nvidia shield. Spotify support blames Nvidia, but I've changed none of my settings. I've filtered their advice to disable up mix and it worked until the next Spotify update. Again they blame Nvidia. But many others are having the same problem. Spotify is full of bugs and doesn't work right in anything but a phone in my experience. Sick of spending more time 'fixing' the app than listening to music.",1
"Love the plethora of genre options, but none of my download playlists work offline. I have tried all the suggested troubleshooting methods from the Spotify community website but this app won't play downloaded content unless I'm connected to wifi. This has been an issue through multiple app updates. My monthly charge goes up from $10.99 to $11.99 for nothing to work offline? I won't be keeping my premium much longer if this keeps up.",2
"Everything was good, but in a past year it goes down, discover weekly is filled of crapy music, for example this week i got only 3 songs which are not lv ru or ukr. I'm not from any of these countries and every week i did click on ""-"" and it was even more flooded by songs of these countries. Custumer support sucks, and i do pay for subscription, if it continues, i think i will delete it. Shitify.",2
"Average, when changing from music to podcasts. Then resuming a podcast the app loses its pathway and hangs. So annoying. Yes I've cleared the cache, yes I've restarted the app. The only thing that works if restarting my phone. Plus when listening to podcasts... Ads! On a paid premium service! Spotify is a joke.",2
"Pretty good but some features are iffy. Lots of great podcasts, pretty exhaustive music library. Starting a local jam seems be doable only at random with a popup. Queue has problems - no play last option, so if you're listening to an album, you have to wait until that one is done before adding the next album, otherwise you will just inject a whole album between two songs of your current album. Also, I prefer Neil Young over Joe Rogan. Offline mode hangs for long periods loading liked dl'd songs",4
"I've been using spotify for years, I've always been able to close the app, and my music or podcasts continue to play. with their recent update, they have made it so everything closes and music or podcasts stops, and I have to reopen the app to keep it playing. Really dislike this.",1
"I really like the app, and I wanna defend it so badly, but the ad system is truly just disappointing. I don't have premium, right? So I just click on my playlist and get like one or 2 ads for 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening. Can somebody tell me why in this God forsaken planet, did I get an ad after a 50-second audio? Literally, not even a minute passed since I started the playlist, and I already got like 3 or more ads. Also doesn't have Malice Mizer here, so major L.",3
"As of Jan 21st you cannot edit your playlist!! When you go to put a song at the top of your playlist is scrambles another song to the top! However, if you make a new playlist you can edit it no problems. The problem is only with the older playlist that have been created for years. look into this ASAP!! LOTS OF OTHERS ARE ALSO 😠 !! This app is starring to be flagged with lots of issues. AS OF JAN/25/24 UPDATE THIS ISSUE IS THE SAME!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!",1
"(Free version) I put a timer on when ads appear, so far for the first time ot only took 8 minutes for an ad to appear. Not the 30 minutes we were promised a million times. Update: was falling asleep to calming classical. Got woken up by a freaking rock band ad. Also, I don't think Spotify is reading all the customer support complaints, as it's been getting worse. Plus the push to become premium is blatantly obvious. I ain't giving you money, as you're obviously hungry for. Plus incredibly buggy.",1
"The shuffle button got even worse. Now it takes almost a minute when clicked for it to respond and disable this horrible smart shuffle. This smart shuffle is so annoying I can't anymore, I'm pulling my hair out!!! I just want to be able to turn shuffle on/off quickly without going through the 7 levels of hell!!! It's been months now, please fix this!!",1
"App seems to unstable and has serious issues with video podcasts. Will be able to start a video podcast but if I stop listening and come back to app, the app will not allow for any video type podcast to play. Regardless if video is inactivated. Other podcasts and songs will work but any podcast with a video option will not play and will need to restart phone, not just app for it to work again. App is up to date, phone is up to date, cannot understand why the issue persists.",1
Spotify do better! You still gonna make me listen to sounds that aren't on my playlist? I'll choose a sound that I want to litesn to and press play to hear a completely different song playing. I HATE THAT. And you be playing my sounds in random order but you have to pay for that same feature in premium. But guess what I don't like that. From now on I'll be using my laptop to listen to music because it gives me my music how I like it.,3
"I usually LOVE Spotify, but recently I've been nothing but pissed off by it. Songs randomly stop playing midsong, a song finishes but doesn't go to the next song in the playlist, or commercials finish but never move on either. This happens both on the app and using a web browser. It's getting to be ridiculous!",1
"I change my mind again lol. It actually isn't that bad. At first I thought that it was because my wifi that I kept getting ads, but it was just the free spotfiy premium that went away. Although, one thing that does confuse me is that everything I try to explore my genres, the music that's playing from it stops after 2 seconds.",4
"Spotify added 2 random playlists to my home screen/recently played, that I cannot remove. Now this is confusing the playlist that I request for, and my speakers will play some random playlist Spotify put onto my home page w/o providing the option to remove playlist. PLEASE ADD THIS OPTION TO REMOVE THESE PLAYLISTS FROM MY ACCOUNT. This request has been asked from other subscription holders since 2018 and several times again in 2020. There is no reason it cannot be fixed immediately. TY!",3
"Used to love Spotify. Then i started listening to white noise overnight and it's ruined my algorithm. The best feature of Spotify was getting recommendations and now, despite the hundreds of musical tracks I have, I practically only get white noise recommended to me. Contacted customer service and there's no way to undo this. Its a real shame, I'm thinking of leaving and checking out YouTube red/ apple music but hopeful for some sort of update that resolves this issue as I have years of playlist",3
"This app has been the cause of many frustrations over the past year. It continually crashes and I have to clear the cache and download the songs again. Crashes on start up more often than it works. When changed to offline mode then it looks for internet and crashes. When working it is fine but unfortunately this is about 15% of the time. Downloaded a library for overseas flight, changed settings to offline mode and then usual crash on startup. I hate this app. Fix the problems",1
"It was okay till ads but now it has restricted everything EVEN THE BASIC STUFF. Can you imagine?? We need to upgrade to premium just skip a song or select the song of our own choice. IT GETS EVEN MORE WORSE...It plays any random song from a different genre saying ""it's similar to your playlist "" And guess what?? YOU CAN'T EVEN SKIP THAT SONG!! The app is getting soo disappointing.. I open the app to get some peace of music but all I end up is with frustration, irritation and a ridiculous mood:)",1
home screen should be customisable. Need a function to delete the unwanted 'your episodes' podcast folder. So slow to load. Ad heavy on Spotify podcasts on premium. Doesn't bookmark podcast list. Only plays the same selection of songs of followed artist and not entire song list. Doesn't save properly when deleting songs. Needs a way to delete multiple/albums at once. Trying to swipe to next song sometimes causes it to go back and forth repeatedly,1
"This is a really good app! Music quality is great, the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because you need to pay to listen to music off-line, and on top of that, you need to pay for it. It's $12.99 and even though it's cheap at first it will cost you more over time. I'd love if there was a longer free trial for around 3 months or it can depend on what subscription you want to buy.",3
"Don't know what's going on with this app but as of recently all it keeps doing every morning is redownloading all my music and playlists that I downloaded for offline use... every morning 5000 plus songs have to reinstalled and it never ends just keeps looping. I have tried so many trouble shooting methods and still no fix, all my songs that usually have a green arrow are all now greyed out with a grey arrow.",2
"I'm genuinely under the impression that Spotify at this point is raising their prices so they can create the most broken & unusable app imaginable. Always appearing 'Offline', playlists are now shuffling ONLY recommended songs, try to turn off smart shuffle or shuffle in general & it doesn't work & just goes back to smart shuffle, major delay in playing/changing songs even when they're all downloaded. It's all gotten so bad to the point that I'm heavily considering changing platforms.",1
"Spotify has always been my go-to for music, and it'll stay this way, but the ads are gett8ng out of hand... itll say one ad then 30 mins of ad free listening, then after the first song plays itll play 4 or 5 ads. Last time i checked, not even 3 mins isnt 30 mins. If the ads were a little cut back, this would easily be a 5/5 as im able to use spotify anywhere and on anything i wish.",3
"I have a playlist of 30+ hrs but when I play it, it will play a few songs l, sometimes 10 sometimes more than I can count, but then start again from the same one, and it gets stuck on a loop. Also, is there a way to keep the music for my kids separate than my own?! Now the DJ started playing toddler songs! (No thank you!)",1
"I've been using this app for more than 4 years and it's always been amazing I love all the new features they add to the app and I love how they include so many different artists on the app it's the best music player I've ever used.Edit-I think Spotify is a great music app but only for music. The audio book thing is such a scam. They only offer 15 hours of ""free listening"" when I'm already paying for premium and when you pass the 15 hours they have you pay MORE MONEY to listen to the audio book.",3
Not able to keep the same song on loop in this new update. The feature seems to be disabled. Still facing the same issue after the new update on 21st. This is now becoming annoying TBH. It was working fine for some days but now the latest update is horrible again. I can seem to use Spotify again if this keeps on happening...it is too annoying now. Horrible experience,1
"Good but occationally it adds random song to playlist which can get pretty anoying depending on if you are open to listening and adding new songs to your playlists or not. For me it wasn't that bad i like the about of songs and artists, i don't know why my android divice doesn't have an option to download music for internetless listening, but the sheer qualitiy of everything else outweight's my personal doubts and issues about this app so i would reccomend this %100",4
"It was way much better previously when there were less ads now you get almost 3 ads each of 30sec which makes your music worse. Now they've started useless stunt to promote premium, you can't even skip to next song. You have limited skips per day. If those are over you can never skip to next song or play from your playlists. I feel like Spotify should be banned. Such a useless app full of ads and wrong lyrics when it comes to local languages like Telugu, Hindi... Is should be in negative rating.",1
"I reformat my phone bc it was too laggy for some reason and i had my spotify premium logged into it with downloads. After i was done setting my phone back up i couldn't listen to my downloaded songs bc it says ""Remove your downloads from other device so you can listen offline"" i was rlly annoyed and i searched for ways i can fix it somehow, but i can't. I would like for spotify to fix this or find a way to prevent this from happening again or commonly in the future.",1
"Newest update has made it so the app won't load. Also, why would I want to keep paying for premium when I only get to make 1/4 the decisions on what I want to listen to or download etc etc etc? It's called premium, not a special feature trial... payment issues, downloaded songs no longer being available/needing to be redownload multiple times, and now I just got signed out in the middle if listening to music. (Jan 29/2024) app now completely closed for absolutely no reason, mid song, regularly..",1
"This is a great music app. It has almost every song I can think of. It just lost a star because I don't want to pay for Premium, but when I get an ad that says you won't have to listen to ads for 30 minutes, I get an ad the very next song which takes 6 minutes at most. Other than way to many ads and a song they took off, this is way better than Pandora.",4
"It's a great app, but they have to stop putting so many adds after only 2 songs have played. Everytime I listen to a 30 minutes of uninterrupted music, 2 songs later I'm hit with adds. Overall though, it's an amazing app and I highly recommend it.",4
The app is easy to use however I gave it a three-star rating because I constantly have to force stop and clear the cache in order to unfreeze it. When switching between Bluetooth back to normal or switching from normal to Bluetooth the app randomly freezes up and I have to force stop and clear the cache in order to get it functional. Sometimes in Android auto it just won't come back until I've been out of the truck and it's fully disabled and then sometimes it's still doesn't work. S23 Ultra,3
"I'm going to be fr. This app has gotten worse. I've had premium for almost three months now, and when i started, everything was okay, no delays, no problems, NOTHING. As soon as I got into the second month,that's when I started to notice some issues with performance. right now, the app won't open. Even after many troubleshooting methods, I still deal with this problem. when it does manage to open, I won't be able to play any songs for a minute or two because it still needs time to connect.",2
"spotify was literally the best app but now the new updates are so bad that they don't even let us listen to a specific part of a song again and again. all these updates are so stupid. we can't even replay a song half way through listening it. we can't even choose the songs we want to play after a certain time, and it asks us to come again the next day to choose the songs we want to listen, this is literally so stupid.",1
"Had spotify permium and not all the music i want is on there but then i went on to free and the absolute bs they pull with the ads doesnt make me want premium back, it makes me regret giving them money in the first place. The same ad back to back to back 3 times in a row? Really? And you cant actually listen to the songs you want, you can listen to a demo, so why am i listening to ads then? All aspects of it are listening to something you dont want to listen to. Not a great business model",2
In the past Spotify was a really good app but even then we got plenty of ads which were really annoying but they were alright because we got to use everything for free but now we can't even play another song. Very basic options such as queue and shuffle require premium. And the ads are worse than before. If the makers think that this will make us buy premium no it won't it'll just promote us to switch apps.,1
I'm using an Android tablet and I can't get the shuffle function to work. Whether the shuffle button is white or green it doesn't shuffle my music. This has been a problem for months and the only way to get it to work is to turn it on using the desktop app on my computer and getting my tablet to sync to that. Also I really don't like that swiping down on the now playing screen minimises it. I don't know if this was always a thing but if it was it has become way too sensitive.,3
"Unable to access the audiobook functions? Been on premium for as long as i can remember. Just heard we can listen to Audiobooks but every choice has a lock on it so i can't access it. Help would be appreciated!! Edit, the team has reached out, and because my account is based in Nz it is not a function at this time, I'm hoping this can change in the future but i have changed my review based on this. Thanks for the reply.",4
"This last update is trash. It looked and worked fine! You don't have to fix something that's already working. The search category looks and feels all cluttery. I liked how I could search from songs, albums, playlists, etc, without all those suggestions. It's feels like Google or Youtube. If I wanted that I would go there! Spotify used to be clean and straightforward. Unnacceptable and seriously considering moving on from Spotify. Please make changes and keep your users.",2
It keeps randomly playing songs that are not in order of my playlist and it keeps skipping songs by itself even though i have shuffle play turned off its really frustrating if i want all the music that starts with A to play i click on the first song it plays and then afterwards it skips like the next 30 songs that starts with A and plays the last one! Really frustrating it needs to be fixed and where is the clear queue button!!!,2
To whom it may be concern. after talking to someone at customer service with Spotify that's the problem with organizing your playlist and they're supposed to be a fix for that I don't know when will it come out so far as right now I'm not able to organize anything and I am tired of going through the steps with them trying to fix it please come out with the fix before I considered on getting rid of the app all together#very unhappy customer,1
"I used spotify for a long time. It used to work fine with no problem, but the last couple of months, it will just stop playing my music for no reason at all, i can restart the song and it will play about 3-4 minutes then stop again if i hit play it will restart the same song. I use it on my Samsung fold 4 with my Bluetooth on my motorcycle helmet. As i said, it used to work fine now there is a lot of glitching",2
"Apart from the podcast and music it hosts the app itself is not worth it, for example there's a handful of frequent bugs you'll encounter but the biggest issue I found was the obserd amount of ads.. it's not uncommon to experience 4 ads in 8 mins or even more with skipping, switching playlists,ect, just feels like you get punished for not buying premium and it only seems to get worse, overall there are better alternatives if your able to use/find them",1
"The like button has been basically nerfed- I can't see my liked songs anymore w/o going to the likes playlist and the ""like"" button is now a plus that is sometimes checked even when the song is not liked and just in one of my playlists. i dont understand why a 'like' button and 'add to playlist' button cant be side by side instead of being one button?? not user friendly while driving or multi-tasking anymore. if not reversed honestly will cancel my subscription",2
I love the music and layout I just hate the fact that for the last couple of months the volume will randomly drop to mute the app will shut off in the middle of a a song and when I restart the app it won't even pick up where I left off or even on the same playlist I have to manually restart everything I've done what tech support says to uninstall and reinstall the app and it still does it,2
Since this update I cannot fast forward nor rewind the song. Did this become a premium feature. The lyric not always available. But the AI generated music choice for me is wonderful I do not get vulgar worded songs and I am very thankful for it why the 5 star rating. The AI did not take long to eliminate bad worded music for me by the second week using the app my music exper6was clean.,5
What is going on with playlists? Now it's impossible to give them an order. The first song shown in any of my playlists is always anyone but the one I chose to be there. I've arranged the order several times and this issue still happens. It's annoying. Songs get all mix up in the playlist and they're difficult to find since the app keeps disordering it. Please fix it. How are we supposed to do playlists like this?,1
"App appears to be broken as of the last week. Podcasts and audiobooks are working but music isn't!! Like NOTHING is loading. And before you say it, I have uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared my cash and data, logged in and out all of the above on my end. Nothing is working with spotify's music right now.",3
"Since the last update spotify doesnt remember the song i was playing, sometimes straight up doesnt open. Have to force close snd reopen multiple times before I get something other than a black screen. Stop messing up something that wasnt broken? Where does my 15 dollars go? Yes I have reinstalled it, even though I shouldn't have too. & now decided that I can select songs from any list EXCEPT my liked songs, then it just stops playing and doesnt do anything. less replying more fixing.",1
"While its the only decent music app here, and has the ability to download podcasts, thats IT. You can't even listen to a particular song anymore, you have to make a playlist, add it, then watch as spotify ruins it by adding songs it 'reccomends'.You have 6 skips an hour. Can't skip to the songs that are actually on your list of songs you like? Too bad, youll just have to wait until you get the song you wanted in the first place. The PC version doesnt do this. Terrible app. Oh yeah, and adds.",2
"Love it but only with premium. I cant always afford to pay for my premium though and when I cant it's pretty bad, normally plays the same few songs over and over and you only get 6 skips an hour. But on premium its actually really good and easy to use! edit: been on premium for a couple years now... my favorite playlist that I made has been removed... fuming.",1
"For podcasts I would recommend using Doggcatcher. It can find more podcasts, allows full control of the order they play, and allows separate values to be used for auto downloading each podcast episode. The interface is also much cleaner. This tries to do too much. The only reason I keep Spotify is for Joe Rogan.",2
"Spotify for Android seems to get worse every update, even for premium users. Most popular filter for podcast episodes are gone, if you search for a song to like but not play it's challenging to do, and whenever I try to go back to whatever I was listening to last time I opened the app, it chooses a completely different song ot episode. And if it does play from the right podcast episode, it starts from a part I have already listened to. Makes me never want up update again bc it just gets worse.",1
"The Only word I can use to describe this app is ""WORST"" . Every freaking thing is premium. Playing a song you want , replying a sing like EVERYTHING. It's so annoying. Before there were only too many annoying adds in between but this is worse. And above all that now I can't even enter the app I don't know why . Horrible experience with the app that made me switch to another music app .",1
"The app continually stops audio playback randomly. I have tried putting my app notifications on silent, cleared cache and app data and reinstalled the app and it is still happening. From what I understand this is an ongoing issue still occuring since 2020. Why havent you fixed it yet? As a premium user this is highly dusappointing and will be cancelling my service until you fix your app.",1
"wow just what i always wanted!! a place to listen to nothing but ads!! /sarcasm ) this is simply an app intended to frustrate you into buying premium, sadly I'd recommend YouTube because somehow Spotify is actually worse, i mean what's the point of an app designed to play music in background when all it does is play ads and crashes when in the background.",1
"mediocre sounds quality and the mobile application never works. always ui lagging and not showing currently playing song. also insanely frustrating bug is that often if I'm offline, it forgets which songs I've downloaded for offline playing. only when i connect will it realise which songs I've downloaded?!😵💩🤯Definitely leaving for good. Even though there's no competition for content. Why spotify, would you make such easy mistakes🤦‍♂️😵",1
Can't get rid of notifnotification bar when in full screen mode. Now I can't watch long podcasts as the notification bar will birn onto my screen. I went through the help and spent 2 hours following their commands and nothing changed. Said they told me that they would email me because they got fed up of trying. That was a week ago I still haven't had that email. How rude,2
"The fact that Spotify keeps opening on it's own whether you want it to or not, and the fact that there's no option to disable that for either the mobile or pc version is the sole reason I uninstalled the app, and gave you guys a 1 star review. It's really [REDACTED] irritating having to close it every time when it opens which is quite frequently, and because of this, I'm thinking of switching solely to Pandora.",1
"Removing the heart feature from mobile was honestly one of the worst things Spotify coulda done. Loved the app beforehand, but now it's this annoying plus sign which makes no sense. It'll ""plus"" songs I don't like and never listen to along with songs I do like, which makes no sense and honestly I struggle to find songs I like now since I used the heart icon to locate them. :/ Would be 4 stars if the heart was still there. Good music app, bad feature change. Also the ui is kind of confusing tbh.",2
"The amount of ads makes it hard to listen to the music. I only listened to Spotify because of Spotify wrapped, but now that other apps have similar features I see little use in using Spotify. I would rather use YouTube where I can listen to the exact music I want without having a pay wall behind ordering my music around and doing other things. I ,personally, dislike that Spotify plays recommended songs when the playlist is done because the recommended songs often are not good fits.",2
"Spotify: Let me add ads, why the heck not YouTube does it! Me: That's understandable. Spotify:Let me disable moving the song timeline for regular users. Me: Thats fine, I don't usually need to listen same phases twice in a song. Spotify: Let me disable moving between songs back and forth, even if it's their own playlist. Me: OK! Spotify: Imma add promo songs in between ads, and in between their playlist. Me: No wonder We going back to On-premises servers from cloud!! SMH Spotify!!",1
To many ads! Even when I get 30 minutes without ads it barely lasts 7! And sometimes it will be 5 minutes of ads and then 4 minutes of music then more ads! It ruins my experience greatly. It is usable for podcasts and such but as a highschool student with an unwealthy family who cannot afford premium it's useless for music! I might as well just watch youtube videos!,2
"It used to be good... 😔 it had better music suggestions, had more than 6 skips per hour, and most important of all, IT DIDN'T BOMBARD YOU WITH ADDS EVERY 5 FREAKING SECONDS... now, its more adds than songs, and sometimes, after an hour, it will still not refill your skips, like I will wake up in the morning like 6 hours after last use, and I wont have any skips to skip freaking bts or Taylor swift songs which sucks also, did I mention the adds? pls fix this,and I will improve it to 5 stars.",2
One of the most important functions got removed somehow?! There is no way anymore to 'hide' (this is what it used to be called) tracks from a radio or public playlists. This is really frustrating as there is a few songs that keep popping up in my rotation that I really despise and there is no way to prevent that. Please devs bring this function back - There seem to be plenty of people irritated by this!,1
"Spotify was my favourite app out there, but now it's the worst. The recent update was so stupid according to me. Can't even play 5 songs!! It says you can only play songs Tomorrow. Can't add songs to queue, can't skip to the favorite part, can't rewind the song, almost all the songs does not have lyrics. It's so frustrating and annoying.",1
"historically have had no issues of any kind, but after a recent update offline mode has completely stopped working for downloaded music. I have uninstalled the app, i have restarted my phone, nothing is allowing me to play downloaded albums. I can play downloaded podcasts, but not music. Remarkably frustrated.",2
"When I click on a song it plays a completly different song or playlist, has 3-5 ads in between every song, doesn't let you go back to previous songs or loop songs, and only offers a very limited amount of skips for their random mash of usually almost intolerable songs of each genre which I think is way overboard to try and force money out of people just trying to listen to music. Literally the only reason I'm somewhat willing to keep it is because it lets me play the music in the background",1
Well!!! It was going all good with Spotify experiences.. but now after one or two months it's asking for premium.. the songs can't be selected with out premium.. the free plan is now removed which is very annoying... Now many people are uninstalling this app unfortunately for this reason.. we hoped that Spotify is a very good free musical app with used to remove our tiredness... Unfortunately it's not working anymore,1
"I absolutely hate spotify now. It used to be so good. First of all, I can't login on multiple device by my phone number. Whenever I put in my phone number which is infact valid, it just tells me to check my number over and over again. Secondly, we can't see which mail is linked to our account which is such a frustrating issue while logging in. Absolute trash for the non-premium users as well. Can't rewind, replay or see the lyrics. So disappointed, uninstalled.",1
"I know this is a stretch but do you guys think you can add a feature that allows us choose a certain genre of songs or certain mood we want in a particular playlist and then your algorithm adds it from the list of our liked songs. Great app btw, best music app fr. Hi there its me again, would really be great if you guys added a feature that allows us change the speed of the song. Also add a feature that allows me shuffle a specific genre of songs in my liked songs.",1
"Why isn't it letting me play my songs offline anymore? The past couple of days I've deleted, reinstalled, and cleared the cache, and it has done absolutely nothing. It just crashes and won't let me listen to my music offline anymore. Spotify is really good, and now I can't listen to my music without WiFi even though I'm on premium",1
"Worst app. Only ads you can listen to this app. And you can't skip songs after 6 skip... Just wow. And everytime they crying for premium membership. Without premium, a normal people can only listen the ads, no music and all. And you can't search new songs there are limits for searching also. Go check some other music apps. I don't recommend this app to anyone.",1
"The Best There Is! (Period!) Love it when after your picks play, it finds similar music/tracks and keeps on Rockin ( or Rollin.) Unfortunately, especially on hours long, or overnight ( ie., sleeping aids, sounds) tracks, intermittent dead air, or static usually accompany these not so ""relaxing"" tracks. It has become more and more problematic as time passes, such that I rarely use them any longer. It Was a nightly practice, that helped sleep quality tremendously- no longer.",4
"It's a disgusting app specially after the new update, as you can't even play your favourite songs when you want, like they are charging money just to change the song it's absolutely the worst experince. In the previous update we weren't able to choose our favourite part of a song and now they just snatch the freedom of a user to change the song. As 1 star is the lowest rating, I'm bound to rate it 1 star, otherwise I would've definetly rated it -10 star. Hope they resolve it in next update.",1
"Every time I try to remove a song from a Playlist, it kinda glitches and sends other songs straight to the top. When I'm done making my playlists from others, sometimes it resets back to all the songs I added. I usually just add different playlists to one big Playlist and remove the ones I don't like but a lot of the times, they reset. :(",3
"Experiencing quite a few bugs lately - app suddenly crashes, even restarting it does not help sometimes, it just hangs. Also unexpectedly pauses playing for some reason while being in background, it's also quite slow in general. Seems to get worse with each update, this was not happening a year ago.",2
"Some of the new interfacing is cool but I am having a ton of trouble recently with songs not being added to my liked songs and I'm also now noticing that an unknown amount of songs have been REMOVED from my 500+ liked songs. With no way to know what's missing and not being able to add what I noticed was missing back to my liked songs I'm pretty upset. As well as with the shuffle playing maybe 1/3 of my songs, it's annoying to constantly skip the same 20ish songs. Maybe YouTube music is better?",1
"love this app but one thing, if your not willing to pay then dont get spotify, because then you cant even choose the song you wanna listen to. but if you ARE willing to pay, its worth it. i just kinda wish there were lyrics for ALL songs (that should have lyrics) bc i like quietly singing along to songs but its pretty hard to learn how to sing it without the lyrics. although if you dont really care about singing along or knowing the lyrics this app is perfect for you",4
"This app has been really slow!! It does not reconigzed when i am online!!! To load the app, a podcast or a song can take up to 3-4 minutes. (With Wifi on) I must add that recently the increased the price which is totally unfair since the service is so much slower and worse than before... You should improve the app urgently, specially if you raise the prise... I would expect improvements if i pay more... not the opposite...",2
"this app is so slow, downloads take multiple minutes to be accessible when there is no internet access, opening the options takes multiple taps, it is the worst app i have used for podcasts and music to be frank, unfortunately most of what i want to access is only accessible through Spotify - would there be an alternative i would switch immediately, the user experience is as bad as it gets",1
"this stupid pre-installed app hijacked my recordings and music and was acting as manager for my Ringtone and alerts...problem was this app is Not native, it's uninstallable and was a 3rd party... IT WAS INTERCEPTING AND FAILING TO PLAY MY RINGTONE FOR CALLS. I turned my phone inside out looking for the culprit until I checked my files and found Blemishify's grubby mitts all over my sound files. UNINSTALLED THIS DAMN THING ON THE ""SPOT"". ALL BETTER NOW!",1
"Spotify was used to be legendary but now I feel like they are forcing you to get premium membership to do basic things like rewinding,replaying songs, shuffle,they even took out lyrics,etc. I hate listening to ads every song ok. They some how take every basic things . At this point i will just go for some other platform.if they continue to do this I am pretty sure they will be out of business soon . One thing that made them popular was there facilities. Now i just wanna give 0 star.wth is wrong",1
I am die hard spotify user for years now.. Premium subscriber as well... Please fix the app .. I have a galaxy s22 ultra and the app many times crashes or lags... Also something I've noticed in comparison to the iPhone... When you are listening to a song that has more than one artists you can't just press on their names and choose which one you want to see.. You have to open the menu and choose the artists option.. Not sure why is that a thing..,2
The app has always been clunky but it's just ridiculous now. You can't even remove episodes from your playlist for podcasts any longer. The option is gone so now my playlist is just full of everything instead of it just being the stuff I haven't listened too. Why would you remove that option. Makes zero sense,1
"came back to this review 7 years later...no changes.app is glitchy and slow, poorly written for consoles, shuffle plays the same songs always and likes to get stuck in a loop of those same songs. the green cirlce of death fills me with joy. Their one and only fix is to delete and reinstall which doesn't fix anything. If netflix can load in a timley fashion and play without any glitches why can't spotify?? A lot of poor reviews on this app, all are correct and not one single response from Spotify",1
"I am editing my old review because my app is constantly crashing, and I have re-downloaded it 4 times, and this error in the system keeps happening. It was fine before now. I can't even open spotify at a certain point with the amount of audio my app bugs out and crashing constantly, so I have to re-downloaded the app again.",1
"It's pretty great overall, but like it's always the same ad playing and gets really boring and is also very annoying. Not only that, but when I search podcasts, the words aren't always synced properly and there are some misspelled words. Plus I really dislike that they add songs to your playlist that u didn't add yourself. It gets really annoying when I want to listen to my own songs but the Spotify added songs keep playing",3
"I love the app, especially as I basically listen to music the whole day. But I've been wanting to make a playlist consisting of musicals recently. Obviously, I want the songs to be in order, but the playlist just randomly puts one song at the top, and if I try to change that, it just takes another song, and then the whole order is ruined. That's very annoying and frustrating",3
"I have been a loyal Spotify premium user for years. I LOVE Spotify. Smart Shuffle is the worst ""feature"" that has ever been added. There is no way to permanently turn it off, and it is incredibly frustrating for multiple reasons. Yes you can turn it off temporarily, but it always comes back on on its own. I will be looking for an alternative music app, which is unfortunate as Spotify WAS the best.",2
"WHAT THE HECK. I've been using a sleep playlist I made for over a year now, almost every night, and I depend on the routine of it being exactly right in order to fall asleep. So, that begs the question, of why it has suddenly decided to start changing itself every few seconds, completely reordering songs and even adding new ones, without me doing anything. It's not on shuffle, my queue is empty, the playlist itself is changing and no amount of editing has resolved this.",2
"This app used to be good, it's slowed right down lately upon opening the app, I have to close and open at least twice to get it going. The new shuffle feature is naff, turns itself on, it has to think before turning itself off, nor does it actually introduce me to new songs! You've increased your charges and delivered a slower service, not cool. Bring back the Spotify that used to be great please!",3
"Spotify has been a part of my life for at least three years. We can listen music and podcasts worldwide easily. Using this app has become annoying since last year. Ads were promised not to appear for the next 30 minutes, but they still appear after one song. Everything becomes premium, such as the desire to play a song, listen to a precious song, want to listen to a favorite line, and many more. We desire to listen to songs in peace, but Spotify is greedy and wants to make money.",1
"They keep adding ""features"" that make the app worse. Smart Shuffle should not be part of the shuffle toggle. It takes a long time to load on long playlists, and it often turns itself back on after I toggle past it. Additionally, they are making it harder and harder to keep your playlists in a custom order. Finally, Liked Songs is now treated like a normal playlist, making it tedious to like songs and to check which songs I've liked. It's all small stuff, yes, but it adds up.",2
"Left a great review, then two days later the whole app hardly functions. I've never had this issue. They seem to have fixed the bug with the music, where I need to reopen the app four times for anything to work. Now, if my desktop at home is on, podcasts WILL NOT PLAY. This is EXTREMELY frustrating and needs to be fixed. A month later and this bug still isn't fixed. I'm paying for a service that's broken. I've been a subscriber for 5+ years and I'm VERY close to cancelling.",2
"The current version 8.9.6.458 shows a bug in one of my playlists. The order of two songs is switched, and when I try to switch them back, nothing happens. When I try to remove one, the song above the one it got switched to replaces the song I just removed. On my other devices, my playlist is fine. I also checked on other accounts, and the songs are in the right order. I don't know what else to do but to point out that there's a bug, and I hope you can squash it as soon as possible.",3
"Spotify is a great app to lister to your favorite songs and artists, and I love it, but I've been experiencing a problem recently. I've used Spotify for a while now, and I don't have premium. Sometimes Spotify will give you 30 minutes of uninterrupted music, but recently, every time I've gotten an ad saying I got that, after a song or two, an ad will pop up. Like, WHERE IS MY 30 MINUTES OF UNINTERRUPTED MUSIC! Otherwise, this is a great app to lister to your favorite artists and songs!",4
"I used to love this app. I've been a heavy user premium user for years. It's gotten so buggy it's mostly unusable. Podcasts won't play. When they do play, they will almost never resume later. My playlist randomly stops. Sometimes, the app won't work at all when I open it. It's just grayed out and unusable. The notification bar frequently breaks. When it does, I can't pause it. It's just an overall really frustrating experience.",1
"This is a best music app but there's one problem, it is unfair for the people who couldn't buy premium just for the songs to play continuously. Well, sometimes when we listen and switch our song to a different one, it would just automatically pop up the premium banner which means we have to buy it so that we could listen to our songs freely. For me, it is specifically not fair since not all people who has a lot of money could buy it.",4
"I have been a long time user of spotify and while I still think it is one of the better options for music streaming out there, I am saddened by all of the features that are being taken away from free users. When I first started using spotify I was even able to choose each song I wanted to play without needing premium. Now I can't even add songs to my playlist from an artists discography. I understand that spotify needs a reliable way to make money but I see it better to add features instead.",3
"Overall good experience, but I preferred it when we were able to add a song to a playlist as many times as we wanted. I like having whatever my current favorite song is in multiple sections, so it's guaranteed to come up more often, but now we're restricted to adding a song into a playlist once. I hate it. It's one of the reasons I moved from YouTube and then Amazon Music, and now Spotify is doing it, too.",4
"The app is basically unusable. The only way for it to actually work is if you have premium. and the ads are OUTRAGEOUS. ""Enjoy the next thirty minutes of uninterrupted listening!"" Then I get MULTIPLE ads not even three songs later. The playlists are literally useless if it's just going to give you random songs that you can't even skip. Whenever you search a song and click play, a completely different song will play and after 4 songs you get to finally listen to it. THIS APP IS HORRIBLE.",1
"I get that it's necessary to make money for you guys, but that doesn't mean the app needs to be basically useless if you don't pay. I get more ads than music most days, and playlists will start playing at random when I open the app. When I have unlimited skips on mix playlists, I'll get an ad, and then I can't skip any more songs after that. I've tried updating, reloading, restarting the app and my phone,and despite that all, the app is still barely usable.",1
"Well, it was my favourite music/ podcast app, but the recent screw ups have sufficiently ruined the experience of it for me. Like many have expressed, yes, the custom orders of playlists I have made have been altered, and I can not get them to go back to how they were. It's very frustrating to want to shuffle, then get random songs added into your playlist. When you think you turned it off, it turns on again. When you are expected to pay a monthly fee ($13AUD) , this is not good enough.",1
"I've always loved Spotify and truly think it's one of the best music streaming apps around, however, I've been having a problem lately. The first 1 or 2 songs in my playlists get jumbled and end up halfway down the playlist rather than at the start. When I go to fix this issue by editing the playlist and pressing save, 2 different songs get jumbled. I like to listen to my music in a specific order so I find this very frustrating.",2
"Spotify is going the same way as other apps who don't listen to customers. I updated to find my playlists have now been totally jumbled with new songs added. In addition. When I select play recommended music, it plays the same few songs repeatedly, despite having amased huge playlists, some with several thousand songs. The design team must be a bunch of amateurs. It was bad enough when the Soundrop feature was removed, but it just goes from bad to worse. Seriously. Considering. An. Alternative.",1
"A great app to listen to music on, irritating to work with if you don't have premium. Works better if you think of it as a radio. Local files are finicky, and they look for audio files that are in the majority of your device. I don't want voice messages showing up with songs I've downloaded! Plus, some of the files don't even play automatically, and they get skipped. What's the use of having local files if they don't want to work?",2
"So I don't know if anybody else is having the same issue as me, but I'm having this issue where almost every one of my playlists have their 1st song switched with whatever song is halfway through the playlist. Even if I go to switch their positions, I hit save and they end up back to where they started. (For example, in a 132 song playlist, the 1st and 66th song will switch and STAY switched as if they have a a weird rule to stay switched.) Good app either way, I enjoy music. Odd bug(?) though.",3
Amazing App! There's so many songs I've never not found a song on it! The Playlist are great and it's so easy to use! I've only had a few small glitches like the music stopping randomly and the previous song title and picture freeze for a long time while the next song plays. It doesn't affect much tho! The Spotify wraps are so fun to open and check what is inside. i'd definitely recommend it!,5
"Stability has been lacking for a few months now, semi-frequent crashes have plagued my listening experience. Sometimes I can listen for hour with no issues, other times I can't even put my phone down before it crashes. Shuffle automatically turns itself on even with automix and similar features disabled, I constantly have to turn it back off. I also still love the part where in offline mode I still have to go online every few hours to remind the app that I still have premium.",1
"It is a very annoying app. It is difficult to make a playlist. When you make a playlist and it reaches the end, it plays songs that are not on your playlist. I love listening to music, and Amazon music doesn't have the artists that I like. Amazon music also plays songs that are not on your playlist, and it is very annoying. Honestly, YouTube would be better if you could turn it off and play songs. Also, I know they are going to respond with pay $$ to get premium. Don't your ads pay you enough?",1
"Spotify was great, but then they added smart shuffle. Smart shuffle automatically turns on. Now for my experience with why it's bad: I was about to drive, so I turned on a playlist with songs that I knew well enough that they wouldn't distract me. Spotify then added a song by a completely new artist that I had never heard of, despite shuffle being COMPLETELY off earlier. There is no way to permanently disable this. Fix this and I will change my review to 5 stars.",1
"All I'm trying to do is listen to songs I downloaded as MP3s, and I thought this was the most convenient way to do so. Apparently not because not only can I literally just not play the songs I want when I put them in a playlist, Spotify then does the ""favor"" of putting other, random songs I have absolutely no interest in into my playlist, which I can't stop despite turning off every setting that should prevent it. It's annoying and not the kind of incentive to get premium y'all think it is.",1
"I love it but... There's a huge glitch with the playlists reordering (moving tracks from the middle to the beginning) on mobile devices. It's frustrating as hell, especially as I am now a paying user. If this is not fixable I'm not sure how useful it is to me going forward ...",3
"Overall, I really like this app, but please add hide options for podcasts, too. there are some podcasts who have audio and video in separate podcasts, and it's kinda bothering. And fix the shuffle option, too. There are some songs that keep playing no matter how many times I skip it. It would be nice if all the songs were in the playlist. Edit: Does the shuffle have preferences to American artists? I don't have a lot of english songs, but it keeps adding them to the playlist",3
"The app works great most of the time other than the abysmal shuffle playlists. The whole point of shuffling is to randomize the playlist, but Spotify seems to play songs in the exact same order every time. This issue has been up on the Spotify community for years, so it's pretty clear there's no plan to fix this moving forward. Keeping for convenience sake at this point, but I'll definitely move to a better app if I find one.",2
"Spotify doesn't seem to be working anymore. You play 2 songs, and the third one doesn't work or when you try to change a song. It completely freezes and continues playing the previous song for a couple of minutes and doesn't change. Also, when you open spotify, it takes quite a while for it to open up, and you are just sitting looking at a blank screen. I have downloaded and redownloaded spotify quite a few times now, and there's no change. I've even switched my phone off and on again.",2
"I love Spotify and I've been using it for years but more recently I've found that I hate the new shuffle feature, it will randomly activate at a random song and I won't even know. I've also been experiencing my songs just stoping, it'll say it's still playing but the audio just stops. I have to pause and un-pause it to get the audio to play but then it'll do it a few minutes after. I've cleared my cache and updated my phone and the app but it still happens. Someone fix it, please!",3
"After god knows how many years, the app finally feels lightweight and quick. No more minutes of waiting before it loads in. No more waiting a million years to turn off shuffle because of Smart shuffle (still buggy tho). However, the ""remove from playlist"" button is placed way too high, so it's easily pressed accidentally. No way to undo either, so the song will be gone you won't have any idea which song it was either. No way to retrieve it either. Very inconvenient. Do the devs even use the app?",3
"Editing since they seem to have fixed the problem with autoplay not working most of the time. Still, this app seems to have some bug or other every other update that cuts the functionality in half or less. Its a nice app when it runs smoothly, and appreciate that the queue functions better than most music apps I've found for my phone. Wouldn't recommend to use it if you're not using premium though, the frequency of ads is not worth it.",3
"I am using spotify app from an year now and the app's library is huge even after the removal of zee music content, the new changes feel a bit different but change is the only constant thing. The only thing I want them to improve is that they should reduce the number of video ads, audio ads are better for music app. Overall, it is a fantastic app even for free usage. Let's come to the present, everything is messed, get a premium for lyrics, sequential play,they will make it a paid app sooon.",2
"What on earth is going on with this app lately? As others have commented, the so-called ""enhanced"" option keeps turning itself on even after it's been disabled and had been doing this for a while. To make matters worse, for some reason, as of this evening, songs in my playlists have had their positions swapped, and each time I try moving them back, they get swapped again! Whatever you've done to cause this, please undo it immediately!",1
"Not possible to play all artists on shuffle. App keeps running in the background after closing it. I have to force stop it in the settings. Also, when restarting the phone. It starts running in the background again and shows up in the notification area even if I didn't open the app, so I have to force stop it every time I turn the phone on too. Ads don't follow my musical preferences. Sometimes I think it's on purpose to bully me into buying premium. Ads are too loud too.",1
"01/23/2024: Your update needs fixing! I have a few playlists that I saved for over a year and I can't seem to edit my playlist properly. I think there is a bug or something. I mean I like how you add the tick button to the liked songs and all playlists, thats cool. But really don't like the random song changes. You always seem to change alot and thinking to made things easy but in a way its MORE harder! Do better Spotify!!",2
"It became best to the baddest platform to listen music. As if we have to skip music more than 5 times we have to buy the premium and we cannot choose the next song,can't play the previous one,can't change the time of the music. If it's not fixed in 10days after this comment I am going to delete spotify from all 12 of my device.IT IS REALLY THE BADDEST PLATFORM TO PLAY MUSIC IN THE STORE",1
"Works fine, but every few updates, the app either removes a good feature, adds an unneeded feature, changes a song's genre listing to either boost the song or boost the genre, or adds a bug that sours the user experience. These are just some of the plights I have about the app. They do add good features some times and fix the bugs often, but testing time for some of these updates should be extended before release. The app is overall good for what it is supposed to do, and I recommend it.",3
"This app has served me right for a long time now and I loved it. Now I fricking hate it. My playlist that's downloaded keeps undownloading when I get off of wifi. What's the point? Also, there a random part of my playlist that keeps coming to the top of the playlist no matter what I do. I tried editing the playlist, I tried deleting the songs then re-adding them, but nothing works. It's the most annoying thing ever. Please fix this and let me have my old playlist back. Then it would be 5 stars.",3
"Not great I'm afraid. The app was working alright until last year, when they introduced the 'smart shuffle' option. This setting has been a pain to use ever since because it doesn't want to stay off, no matter what you do. If you have a limited data connection then smart shuffle will download the next 100 songs in your current playlist( even if you disable download over cellular data) so imagine my surprise when I lost half of my monthly allowance because of this smart shuffle.",1
"This app is not at all user-friendly. I can't for the life of me find a 'help' option that many apps have, which I remember there being, so there should be one. The 'settings' icon has gone for me, so I now have to go through my profile to get to my settings. There is also a problem with one of my my playlists. It swapped a song with another, and even if I swap them back through editing the playlist, it doesn't actually change it. Please fix this",1
"My music keeps pausing for no apparent reason. When I open the app it says 'No internet connection', except I do have WiFi and regardless my music is downloaded so why should that matter!? And not to mention smart shuffle, a stupid pointless feature, keeps randomly turning on even though I have it disabled! This app is just broken. It shouldn't be so hard to make a functioning music app ffs Spotify!!!",1
"I always loved Spotify but for a last few weeks it act worse on my device. They add lots of new features but it seems to affect core functionality: music playback. It often resets your current queue if you connect from other device or reopen the app after some time. Also the navigation is far from perfect (I prefer albums over playlists buy that's Spotify's ""thing"", I guess). I was always advocating it for my friends but with the recent issues not even sure if I'd like to keep using it longer",3
"Still needs a lot of work. When a podcast episode ends it doesn't continue to the next one based on release date, sometimes I get a random episode or even the previous one. Especially bad on my Polestar 2 version where scrolling and sorting are abysmal and also has the same issue. I pay premium for this service and you keep trying to get me to stop.",2
"Even after several updates, I'm still having issues with shuffle and the play queue. If I add the song that is currently playing to the queue, it will start playing from the point I was at in the song when I added it, instead of the start - the smart shuffle option also often refuses to turn off even if the symbol changes to regular shuffle. Also, I have no idea who decided to treat liked songs as a regular playlist, but it was a ridiculous change that makes the app so much less intuitive.",2
"I absolutely love the app but, there are way too many ads. It's like they're doing what Pandora used to do which was play an ad after literally every song. But it's worse with Spotify. It'll play anywhere between three and seven ads at a time. Spotify devs REALLY need to fix this issue. Even if it's by removing at least one or two ads played, I would be satisfied.",4
"Based purely on the podcast section. Unintuitive UI. Impossible to pick a series and play through each episode. Ads in podcasts even though I pay premium. Struggle to find where podcasts I follow can be found. Constantly showing me podcasts I am not subscribed to trying to get me to subscribe, of which I have zero intrest in. Easiest fix would be a 'playlist'option for podcasts, exactly the same as for music on the app.",1
"I am taking a Star off my review due to the gargantuan amount of ads, I would understand one here and there, but I once got 5 ads back to back for a 2 minute song. Otherwise, I would consider this a great application for music, as it has introduced me to many new bands and genres I probably would not have heard of before, especially with the podcasts. It's crazy to think a mere 2 decades ago, It would've cost an arm and a leg for all these albums that are now so easily available.",4
"Bring back the Playlist radio function as soon as possible! The ""Enhance"" feature is really not good for finding songs! I really don't get, why spotify keeps removing features that people use! 😑😑 Edit: This app is getting increasingly worse. I only want to listen to music. Instead I now get shorts? Please at least add an option to remove the shorts!!",1
"Worst functioning app on my phone. The only app that freezes constantly. It just won't play certain podcasts sometimes. Right now I can play any song or podcast but the 3 latest podcasts won't play. I've restarted the phone, cleaned the phone memory, etc... The only way that fixes it is to uninstall the app and reinstall it. And that doesn't always work. The only reason I pay for this is to listen to Joe Rogan and IT NEVER WORKS!!! Also, the only app the won't scroll for the first 15 seconds",1
"The mobile version is awful in comparison to the desktop version. Not letting me pick a song that I want to listen to - the dumbest decision ever. All you can do is start listening to your playlist, which is shuffled randomly. Have I also mentioned the fact that you can skip a song only 6 times per hour while listening to your randomly shuffled playlist? Use something else if you want to listen to music on a mobile device. Atrocious application.",1
"I pay for premium service. I had to reboot my phone, and the storage was switched from my SD card to internal storage. When I switched it back, all of my downloads were gone. Hundreds of songs and dozens of audio books! It will take me hours to download everything again!!",1
"Honestly really good (for me at least) when it comes to listening to music. I have premium, and imo it's worth it, but that might just be me. but when I tried to reorganize my main playlist just to make everything easier on my perfectionist ah brain, it keeps moving VALENTINE (Måneskin) to the top of the Vocaloid section. That's less of a criticism more of an inconvenience, but it's really annoying cuz I get bothered by the little things. Also sometimes it just won't play a song despite being on",4
"I love Spotify in that I can select songs to create my own playlist. That being said however, 99% of the time I start listening to my playlist and after the first song I get a series of ads and then says that I will get 30 minutes of ad free music. One song later and I'm getting repeat ads all over again. I understand I will have to endure the ads without premium, but I don't want ads after every song. Also, the shuffle plays the same 5 songs over and over out of my 200 on my list.",2
"Beware free users. They made the free experience horrendous, no doubt on purpose. Even if you watch ads for ""30mins of free music,"" it'll still make you watch ads every single time you switch albums regardless. If you have playlists, it forcefully plays songs that aren't in it. I would say premium is worth it, but they just jacked up the prices on all plans. Might be worth if they made the app function better but it's exactly the same, just more expensive.",3
Was frustrated when they made us to restrict to got to previous songs and choose the playback feature even after listening/watching loads of Advts. Now I can't even listen to my songs from my playlist and skip the songs with restricted access. Why the hell do they make us watch/listen to the Ads. No use of keeping this app installed anymore. Wynk Seems to be the best alternative.,1
"Wish it cost less for premium, but it's almost worth the subscription honestly. I HATE ads in my music, and some days I skip even the songs I love the most. The ""made for you"" lists are almost always on point, with songs I either already love, or brand new faves. Love that the updated ""add to Playlist"" feature FINALLY lets you add a song to many playlists at once; I've been waiting for this update since I started making playlists originally! Still, they're charging about 5$ too much, IMO.",4
Premium Subscription I only use for Podcasts. Since update a few hours ago podcasts are moving out of order in my playlists. The top podcast I am listening to moves to somewhere towards the middle. The podcast that is in that place moves to the top. I am unable to edit the playlist. Received support feedback to update phone reinstall app and restart phone. Did not work.,2
"As a podcast player, this app is a bit annoying when trying to listen to a queue of episodes. For such a popular player, I can't believe that they have no way to sort them by oldest to newest on Android, only newest to oldest. Update: for some reason the app is shuffling my ""my episodes"" list even though it isn't an option a user can turn on and off.",2
"Been using Spotify for years and years. Tye selection of content has always been incredible, but the app itself gets worse with each update. Artist radios are getting worse about content, podcasts have gotten miserable to listen to, especially when you're deep into the back catalog. It's they're actively trying to make the user experience worse with each update.",3
"This was awful, the sound quality sucks and I keep getting random songs added to the Playlist. At first I was able to skip songs and search songs up as I wished, but then it suddenly kept giving me so many ads and only gives me 6 skips an hour. I can't even look up songs anymore, only with premium you can search for songs, which makes it pointless. This was dissapointing and I don't quite understand why anyone would choose to pay for Spotify. 0/10, don't waste your time.",1
"The radio algorithm is repetitive. Adding to a que is clunky and ineffective. There's no ""play next"" button. You can't add a whole album to a que and it stay in order. You can't cue up multiple albums and them stay in order. I hat this program, but Google Music shutdown and this is slightly better than YouTube Music. Anyone have a good option out there? Edit: the longer I use this, the more I hate it. It's so clunky. Edit: with every update the app gets worse...",1
"The newest update is glitched. It switches where the first song in the playlist is with another song in the playlist. There's no way to fix it, because if you change the order of the songs back to normal on mobile, then the songs get reversed on desktop. Please fix it so that the order of songs on my playlists is consistent and normal on all devices.",2
"Spotify used to be so much better. We need old spotify back. It just randomly shuffles my playlist, it wasn't like this at all. Hopefully creators will make it better or back to how it was. Then also I kept using it because it had a variety of musics, why making it so premium? The adds just come up after 2-3 songs everytime. So annoying. Podcasts are great, no doubt but lessen the adds. Hopefully creators will pay attention to this, there is so much more to say.",1
"I have listened to music on this app for so long. But the new features are ridiculous. I understand that you want users to buy subscription,so you auto-shuffle the list. But this smart shuffle doesn't even play songs from a playlist when it is specifically asked to do so. Now Spotify is irritating. I took a week-subscription and was disappointed with the experience. I was told that I got 14 days subscription but the download list disappeared in a week. Will switch apps soon",2
"It's a very good app! I do have one thing wrong with it. There's way to much ads! Even after it says ""we'll give you a 30 minute break of ads!"" It doesn't. And sometimes it plays a ad in the middle of a song witch is confusing cause it's not supposed to do that. I just exit out of the app and re open it when there's an ad. It really helps!",4
"wish i could give this app a negative rating. ive been using spotify for years now and i loved it because of its interface and large variety in music. unfortunately the app has put even the most basic features like looping and rewinding songs behind a paywall. definitely not good marketing, pretty sure many people wouldn't want to pay for the bare minimum.",1
"I can't even listen to a song without getting bombarded with 9 ads, it used to be 30 mins of music before the next ad but now it's uncontrollable. I cant even listen to music without this shuffling thing, it's out of my control and it puts on songs I don't want, what's the point of using Spotify if it puts on the music you don't want. I get that Spotify wants to make premium more enjoyable for those who buy it so that more people can buy it but the updates are completely unhelpful and annoying",1
"I really love this app, but it just recently started to mess with my playlist by taking random songs from my playlist and moving them to the very top. The songs won't move back to the order they were in, or another random song with be put at the top and replace the other one after I just put it back to its spot. Everytime I edit to move them back to the spot I ordered them to be in it just won't? It will go back up to the top. I like keeping things organised and this makes it impossible. Fix it",3
"Songs take ages to load up, even when downloaded and especially when you have poor connection. When I'm paying for premium, I expect to have instant access to download songs as a minimum. The new enhanced shuffle toggle is poorly designed, I just want to turn shuffle on/off. Often the app just sets enhanced shuffle as default and even when I turn shuffle off it will just default back. Overall the UI and experience is poor, and I expect a better app for the money they charge.",2
"The new ""feature"", audiobooks, are a PAID extra to a premium subscription. Yes there are free titles. But none that I've seen are even remotely interesting enough to try it out for even a minute. So hard pass there. Honestly, thinking about it now. It's not worth paying for everything when it comes bundled with my cell phone plan.",1
"Recently updated and now Spotify barely plays a song before it stops completely. Happens to me and my family who use the family plan. I'm paying nearly 20 quid for this rubbish app. It's disgusting that even after reinstalling, changing settings and anything else I can think of, the bug is still there! Considering the amount of complaints on your forums, how has Spotify not fixed the bug?? Surely someone in their technical team can do their job. If this isn't fixed I will end my subscription.",1
"Review update; my current issue with Spotify is now multiple of my playlists have been jumbled a bit. A couple of songs have moved out of place to the top of my playlists & when I try to rearrange them back into the correct order and press the save button, a song or two gets moved to the top of the playlist; out of place again. & this is paid Spotify, very frustrating.",1
"I love this app and enjoying music on it, but I cannot seem to get it to play all the songs on my playlist. It has a clear preference towards some songs and I don't understand how every time I shuffle the playlist, it queues them WITHOUT FAIL. It's generally popular artists too which makes me think they are either paying for better spots, or the randomize option is not actually random. I have reinstalled the app as of today and it is still doing the same thing as it was before",3
"I switched to spotify from Pandora because I felt the algorithm played music more to your tastes. Plus the list option for Playlists is great. But if you're not ad free good luck playing specific songs you want to hear after an ad. No, it plays other random songs first before you get to hear the song you picked. Also your Playlists have to be randomized to listen to if ad free. You can't pick and choose. I signed up for ads to pick what I listened to but can't get that. Going back.",2
"Spotify is a pretty solid music app. I really do love it however I've noticed with its smart shuffle that each time I use it, it doesn't shuffle my music but rather repeats them. When I try to like something with the new + feature, it says it adds it to liked song but then I check and it's not. I have to manually add it to liked songs and even then sometimes it doesn't register. Please fix",4
The quality of both the desktop and mobile app continue to fall but most notably the mobile app. The only reason I pay for premium is to listen to music offline but the app barely functions without a connection. Why pay so much for something that hardly works? There's so much bloating with unnecessary features and the albums I like are often hit with copyright strikes for their sampling and removed. Corportate greed is at an all time high it seems.,1
"Been loyal since 2010.. I have no idea what has gotten into the Spotify team but this app has become absolute GARBAGE. Song radios just show a bunch of my already added songs on a playlist instead of different songs. Both shuffles won't turn off even when it says it's off. Shuts off sporadically, won't play queued songs, won't add songs, glitches & repeats the same 4 songs, will randomly go back to the beginning of a playlist, etc👎 its becoming unusable. On top of the increased price? Awful.",1
"I hate how if you don't have Spotify premium, you can't really do anything with this app. You can't listen to one song without having a bunch of ads before it, you can only skip 6 songs every hr, sometimes when I play a song that I want, it will play a completely different song instead and even after using up all my skips it still won't play that song",3
"Usually I'm pretty happy with Spotify and it's playlists. I made a bunch of band Discography playlists so I can just sit and listen without the need to change it all the time, but as of the recent update a bunch of my playlists are now uneditable and the app has moved a bunch of songs into the wrong order, as stated I'm unable to correct this. I tried to remake the playlist and it still does it. If the Spotify Devs see this can you please look into this and sort it.",3
"All this time I have been accustomed to the overload of ads interrupting my seamless experience, but now even the basic features like skipping to a favourite part of the song, and listening to songs in order (among others) have been removed from the free version. This is so NOT cool! Edit: Now for free version there's just 6 skips/hour and it doesn't even let me play the song I choose!? SPOTIFY WHAT THE HECK!",1
"i've had premium for a few years now, but i'm genuinely considering cancelling. not only does spotify pay artists hardly anything, but the newest smart shuffle feature is genuinely the worst. i liked the original radio feature, but i hate having my playlist interrupted by songs that don't match. i don't want to have to be on offline mode to ensure that it doesn't turn on, especially when that doesn't keep normal shuffle on in the first place! it likes to turn off shuffle after a few songs now :/",1
"been using spotify for years, and i love it a lot. music is a part of my life and im grateful to have spotify. one small hiccup that i sincerely hope gets fixed. whenever i shuffle an artist, itll only play a select few songs on different devices, e.g. on my phone, it only plays a few and not the entire discography, while on the computer it plays it all. a bit annoying especially when im at work and i want to listen to my favorite artist, please fix this and ill gladly change to five stars.",3
"Spotify ruined music for me. Music is meant to be shared. After having other people play music on my phone in a car trip my listening experience has been horrible. I put on a metal playlist - app plays pop after one song, rather than continue from the playlist. WHATS THE POINT OF A PLAYLIST IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW IT!? What's even worse is there is no customer service to call. This is like breaking up over text. I can't recommend this as a paid service and have cancelled my subscription.",1
"TL;DR - Before asking users to rate the app, make sure it isn't going to have something break within seconds of closing the annoying ""rate us!"" popup. Today, Spotify asked me to rate them on the store. Also today, every one of my longer playlists has had the position of its first song swapped with a song halfway through the list. I have used Spotify for many years, and in all that time they've continually updated the app to be worse - this is just the latest (and weirdest) instability so far.",1
"I absolutely love it! Genres covered and vast array of music/songs available are unbelievable. Fast and easy downloads are great. However, I have two issues: I can not delete some downloaded stuff. Mandarin songs seem to have been chosen by somebody speaking cantonese and by Hong Kong artists singing in mandarin. I need the real main land music, old and new.",4
I am giving Spotify for star rating because one sometimes when I'm on my Xbox my music just stops on an ad the ad doesn't continue playing on and it literally comes to her after quit the app reopen up the app restart my whole playlist cuz they don't tell me where I was and it's so annoying to do that every hour or two . I think that Spotify makes a lot of the music app standards and it creates the playlist just for me and my type of music that I like and enjoy listening to thank you Spotify,4
"Evrything was great tbh. This used to be my go to platform to stream music. Huge library of songs, artists, podcasts. What not to love right? But from a few months back the need for a premium subscruption has been growing. Enjoying a sad playlist, NOPE here comes the add. U can't go to a specific part in a song. Like, that's supposed to be one the most basic things you would want from your music streaming app. It still does holds superiorty to the yt music app because of background playing tho.",2
"I've been using Spotify for years and liked it a lot. But since I got a new phone with Android 14 it all went downhill - playback is going silent at random and not even skipping to next song. Also, connection in my car is also unstable, sometimes it plays, sometimes just silent and I need to reconnect. Seems like mix of OS version, BT (?) and Spotify problem. Which wasn't there on Android 12 with same app version. If this is not fixed soon I'll stop paying for this and find another app.",3
"It is a convenient app since it has a huge selection of music and podcast. However, if you really care about music, you just gotta hate the way Spotify is compressing the files, taking away every single detail you would hear on vinyl. Truly awful. But I guess the main target group doesn't care about these things.",2
"keeps playing suggested songs while im listening to playlists, if i wanted suggested songs I wouldn't put together playlists. Plus the songs have nothing to do with the playlist. Keeps playing 4+ ads at a time. When I'm trying to find a song and click play on it it never plays the song, instead it plays a song by the same artist. On computer it's fine but mobile is horrible",1
"It's an okay app. I do notice however when your listening to an ad that's supposed to give you 30 minutes of uninterrupted music after listening to it, it's not true one time it only played one song before going to another ad. Another time it played a little under 20 mins before going to an ad. I just don't like the lies. On top of that you upped the price of the subscription and all I have been dealing with since then is Spotify constantly crashing or not working at all.",3
"Usually I give Spotify 5 stars since I use this app a lot... but now I'm dropping it a bit since I'm not a fan of how buggy it's becoming a little. I'm having this issue where you arrange songs and somehow, a different song gets put on top of the list when I never even touched it. I'm not sure if it's just me, but this is actually annoying and I was freaking out thinking someone is messing with my account. Any advice or suggestions would help please... and thank you.",2
"I love this app. But there are so many things that need to change for the free plan. 6 skips per minute? Not being able to pick a song to start with? I didn't mind the ads when I could pick a song to play and skip songs freely. But still, too many ads. I once got like 4 in a row. It is infuriating that I can not skip more than six times an hour. I want to make a playlist for songs I want to listen to now, but I'm not certain I'll even be able to listen to a song that I want to in a new playlist.",2
"Pauses every few minutes both on lock screen and in the app itself. But ONLY when my Bluetooth Speaker is connected. Tried everything, log out, change password, reinstall app, nothing fixes it. Happens both on S22 Ultra and S24 Ultra. EDIT: apparently factory resetting the bluetooth speaker (NOT PHONE!!!) fixed it. Been listening for close to half an hour, not a single pause.",4
"This app is terrible. Can't preview songs, can't choose what songs I want from my own playlists, shuffle function is a joke. Tried using Chrome app to log in, and same issues, and can't even find my own playlists after I log in. Deleting from my phone, I'll use the desktop web version but not the garbage they have for mobile.",1
"Usually I ball out with this app, however recently my alphabetical playlist has been bugged. Songs from the ""L"" section of my playlist are being swapped with songs from the ""A"" section of my playlist without my input and everytime I fix the playlist, the songs just swap again. Until they fix this bug I don't recommend the app.",1
"Great content, suggestions, and well organized. For a while the app was running slow on start up, but that seems to be figured out. My main gripe now is when you navigate to a podcast, it takes you to the newest episode rather than back to where you left off. Not sure why they removed that feature.",4
"I've been a Spotify Premium user years. This might soon change. Spotify support and connectivity for Chromecast is absolute hot garbage. No song is playable, and Spotify continue to skip through every song on the list, without playing any songs. Uninstalling, clearing caches, resetting phone, resetting Chromecast, resetting network. Every app but Spotify works perfectly. This has been an issue for several weeks now and there are still no solution to this problem.",1
"So pathetic app, can't even choose the music I want to play. It play some other song which it recommendes i.e not from my own list. It's showing to opt for premium. Its ok if you promote the premium features but don't make it as a headache for the user, feels like you force someone to do what you want. The non premium users are fine with the ads but please allow us to play the music we want to hear.",1
"App is really buggy lately, I just think it's too bloated and doesn't have enough testers. Constant connection issues, even when my wifi or data connection is strong and other apps can connect. Playlists and queue skip all over the place. I just think Spotify is so ubiquitous now they stopped caring, since they figure folks will keep using it. But they really need more UX testers, the poor quality control is very noticeable.",2
"The last several days, I've been using the Spotify app and I found one annoying issue that when we press the headset's center button, music begins to play even app is not running in background. This problem also happens with Bluetooth headphones. I've reported this issue with screen recording and the steps to reproduce it, but instead of fixing the problem, they keep requesting me to run the test cases in my device. Its your job to reproduce it and fix it right? Very very worst behaviour 🤬🤬",1
"I don't know if anyone else has this happen, mine just randomly skips to a different podcast. Example, listening to listened to The Strata, S2 Army of One PT 2 and when that was done it went to Dungeons & Daddies S2 episode 7 and now it happened again, listening to creepsmcpasta and instead of going to the next cast, it jumped back several casts from where I was just listening. Please fix this!!!",3
"I only used Spotify for asmr but one feature instantly messed it up where without premium you can't play artists albums in order. It randomizes there tracks from various albums meaning albums are pointless unless you have premium which I'm unwilling to pay for. I'm just gonna go use sound cloud cause at least they don't FORCE YOU TO PAY TO LISTEN TO SONGS IN ORDER! Thanks, spotify, you money hungry jerks.",1
With updates it's getting more and more annoying. I mean you open app for listening music.. nope you will have to listen and watch 2 or more ads. And then you can listen.. oops don't you dare to flip to other song you might have to listen another ads and guess what u can't re-play that song after. Very very annoying and not friendly . I don't know what is happening just premium package seller app.,1
"I typically love Spotify. I've been using it for years and I love all the features! However, after this last update all my downloaded songs disappear consistently even after re-downloading and I can no longer listen to them offline. This is especially an issue because I have my own music I add to Spotify from my PC and I can typically hit download on my mobile version and listen to those songs mixed in with the music that's already in Spotify even away from my PC. Hopefully this gets fixed soon.",3
"I understand that Spotify wants users to buy premium but the updates are getting more and more ridiculous. As basic function as a 'shuffle' isn't even doing its job, I can't replay or skip to the part of songs, everytime I have to reopen the app and play the songs from the beginning this is really annoying & not even counting the amount of ad interruptions. Even If these basic functions are not free then I think we gonna need to switch app soon.",1
"I've had Spotify premium for many years now but I'll be cancelling soon. The main reason for using Spotify has always been music discovery, which now has become completely useless. Barely any new songs have come up in the last few months, it constantly plays the same songs over and over.",1
"I have been using the app for years now, and all was fine just up until a month or two ago. I have premium, and for some reason, half of my playlists won't load while I have no internet connection. And now, for the past week or two, I've had problems where even whilst I am using internet connection, it says all of my songs are not downloaded.",3
"Spotify is one of the most manipulative and annoying apps, used to be fun, but always upgrading nothing new/ changes. The most annoying issue(?) the app SHUTS DOWN in the middle of a song. An endless boulevard of mindless commercials!Lately, they've promise 30 minutes free music after ADS, not true, lies every other song Interrupts with ADS! IT'S BRAINWASHING. It promotes Alzheimer's. Like cable TV it's commercials, you don't remember what you were watching, constant interruptions memory loss.",2
I would rate the app much higher except for a glaring problem. I like to listen to music as I try to fall asleep. Spotify has many great options to choose from but as I try to fall asleep the adds wake me up because they are played at least at 5 times the volume as the content. AN OBVIOUSE TACTIC TO TRY GET YOU TO PAY FOR PREMIUM! A SHAMEFUL BUSINESS PRACTICE!,1
"The UI and non premium features are slowly deteriorating. Free accounts can no longer enhance/smart shuffle playlists (incorporate similar songs but not fully add them). Also, I can't add playlists to my profile. Most of my playlists are public, but only a few show up on my profile. The option to add the rest is nonexistent. I've been using spotify for a few years now, and it just gets worse with every update. It's very obvious how stingy they're being with non premium users :/",3
"This app has gotten so laggy and buggy it's almost unusable, can take upwards of 30 seconds to change to the next song or go to another menu. This wasn't the case a few months ago, after a certain update it became like I was using a computer from 2000 that had too many apps running.",1
"I'm changing my 5 star review to 2 stars because of these reasons. 01. I'm a premium user since years, and sometimes the shuffle button broke. It always enables the recommended songs to my Playlist even I turn it off. It's very frustrating. 02. Ordering a Playlist is broke and the app is messing the order by it self. This is definitely BugSpotify now.",2
"Everything is good but they are asking for premium in everything. like if you want to change the song you need premium,if you want to make the song in repeated mode you have to take premium.what the hell Spotify is doing.if there will be a option of 0 rating then I would like to give 0 rating.spotify used to be my only favourite aap for song but now I don't think so I will go back to Spotify and the most important thingthe ads are just like too annoying.Really disappointed by Spotify.",1
"Smart shuffle breaks shuffle constantly. For the love of god make smart shuffle it's own individual button and not built into shuffle. If I hit shuffle and I don't like the shuffle I want to unshuffle then reshuffle, something that took all of 3-4 seconds before now takes 10 seconds minimum if not more because it has to load songs, and it doesn't help if Internet is slow. I can't every freaking disabled it. Not user friendly and as a user of 7+ years very disappointed.",2
"It's an amazing app, it's definitely my favourite music app. I did have a small problem though I bought premium and cancelled a month after in the playstore because I wanted even though it was amazing, and it didn't cancell it took around €22 out of my account if you want to cancel please do it on the app!!",4
"Such a Bad experience. In starting I loved Spotify. But now, I m going to uninstall Spotify At every move they just ask for premium. I can't even play next song now because it's shows a popup that ""u have got 6 skips per hour. U will get more skips tomorrow"" what is this yrr.. such a disturbance while listening music. After having good network, it shows u have no internet connection. Why dude?",1
I love the app. I can listen to so many different types of music and I love it. But i've come across a problem. Sometimes I will be listening to music and then stop it for just a second but when I try to reopen the app to resume listening it does not load at all and gives me a blank screen or it will load for a long time and then tell me there is a problem. I can't figure out why this is happening please help.,4
"Always locks up, I'll be listening to a podcast and then pause it, come back a few hrs later or even next day and I'll hit play and nothing happens, acts like I don't have service but I do. Reset the phone, close the app none of that works. End up having to uninstall and then re install to get it to work. Extremely annoying",3
I liked it before but not now since new update. I think you have to make it completely premium. Because it is not suit to say it free . There is a very limited chance even to change or skip songs. I can't play manually after the limit is end. I can just to pause or play. You want premium for everything all except it. Very cheap idea to earn money🙁,2
"No end of problems - kept playing songs but without the sound so tried deleting and reinstalling the app but keeps doing the same problem. Also will randomly switch to a previous playlist when I'm in the middle of a different one, and will sometimes come up with the loading circle when I go into my library. I've downloaded playlists/albums to listen offline while I'm out but it comes up saying this can't be played due to no internet connectivity. Seriously reconsidering using this app",1
"i don't know what happened with the recent update, but the ""add to profile"" option for playlists has disappeared. please do something about this, and maybe other users are also having this problem that they can't add playlists to their profile. thank you!",3
"I love spotify because you can listen to all types of music but i dont have money to get premium and if i dont have it i only get 6 skips for a certain amount of time and i cant even pick the song i want to listen to and on top of that they have the ads that last longer then the 30 minutes we get to listen to the music its just anoying , instead we should atleast be able to pick our own songs like come on .",3
"App is great, i love spotify and have been a member for years. -Edited- I gave the app a 1 star review when they removed the heart to save songs in a simple manner. The method that replaced it is now gone. There is one issue left. Go ahead and squeeze that 1 minute you have while you're at work, but a jam is on to Shazam a song and then save it on Spotify without 5 pops up just to save 1 song. If you save the wrong song, I dare you to hit that button again, you'll get the pop-up to remove it.",4
"If you like paying for a streaming service that proports to offer an add free experience but want to then have ads in your podcasts this is the app for you. What a joke. Paying for no ads, yet every podcast I listen to has multiple ads spliced into it. These are even geotargeted to the point where I am getting Australian ads in American podcasts. Spotify is clearly enabling this and double dipping with the user and advertiser payment. Rort!",1
"App is really slow now, and it won't connect to my house Sonos system any longer. It keeps flashing saying it's connecting, but it doesn't connect. Deleted the app and reinstalled it, done the same with Sonos app. Now looking at other music apps after years with Spotify, it's not what it used to be.",1
"Mobile version of Spotify is kinda wack imo, it won't play in the background (despite settlings) and there no way for me to put repeat on a song :P plus the playlists *I* make I can't even play, it give the recommendations or something. So I don't recommend this PERSONALLY on moblie bc it's just kinda wack, but otherwise it's a good app, lots of songs, good platform, fun things like dates and Spotify wrapped, its fun",4
"I have spoken with customer service probably 6 times. Why can't you guys put out something relevant to all your customers or fix the bug that allows the app to annoyingly auto play when connected to Bluetooth? ""Please reach out to customer service"" I have 6 times and NOTHING WORKS. ZERO. I want to be able to open the app and not have Spotify automatically play in the morning with a new born. I've updated, gone through file manager, logged out of all devices, created a new password, etc. NOTHING",1
"idk what happened but my account is slow just malfunctioning. I can't even open my liked songs anymore, music stops every 30ish seconds, and I've tried everything, believe me. I've tried clearing the cache on the app, theough my phone settings, heck I've even restarted my phone twice. and to add to that, I've done this with all of my devices. I swear, with every update this app gets worse and worse. please fix your app and please fix my account.",1
"first is okay，but nearby the day，the app started got some problem，if i want to arrange song in playlist，it automatic not under my control. Example the 15th song move to the 1st place,but after that the 16th song automatic to the 2nd place or opposite,please maintance and repair as fast as possible thanks again!! It just okay in the computer , computer do not have this problem, only handphone has this problem. it actually is a trouble to me",1
I like using the free version of the app they added Infinite skips back on the phone version and there are less ads then there used to be. But what sucks Is that when you try to get free trial for premium and you have to put in a credit card number (which I am too young to own). Which makes no sense because it's free. I think that is kinda bull.,2
"Without premium this app is useless. You cannot pick an individual song from search or even a playlist. Only 6 skips per hour and ads when half of it is just silence. As is for many people, music is my coping mechanism and not having it is very difficult for me to go about everyday life. Maybe you should stop being so cheap and charge less for premium or at least lower the absurd rules for a premium free account. It's crazy.",1
I'm having issues with accessing downloaded media while using the app when offline. I contacted Spotify for assistance with this and they totally ignored my actual query and blamed it on having a VPN. I fail to see how a VPN is causing the problem when I'm entirely offline. Their app keeps getting worse and they refuse to help customers who are experiencing issues.,1
Force stops all the time now. Spotify use to be able to run all day without force stopping. Now every 30 minutes-1hour it'll just stop for no reason. Getting sick of it. It's updated and I have Uninstalled and reinstalled already. It's just way past the time I go to another app bc putting lyrics behind a paywall? Not being able to look through an artists song and click on it like you use to be able to for free? Are you for real? Plus it's not like they pay artists what they deserve. Do better.,2
At first when I downloaded the app it was too good but now it seems like the app has turned into something else its like you can skips songs only 6 times in a hour like what the heck. u can't choose the song always something else plays up which is really frustrating and annoying like it was ok in the beginning but now it really needs to b changed,2
"This is the worst app of song. We can't play our playlist. It take us away. We can't go backward. Too many adds. We can't play song in order. Many options are gone. The hide song also playing sometimes. Very irritating app. Worst, waste, garbage, irritating, useless app",1
I really love the app and I feel like it's the best but ever since the latest update I feel like it crashed the app of some sort. It loads for a very long time and when it eventually does the music won't play. And then recently if I launch the app it won't load and it will say Spotify has stopped. you guys should fix it cause am not uninstalling it to download it back because Redownloading my songs won't be funny,2
"For some reason, when I add songs to my library and I play them, only about five seconds of the song plays. I can't listen to the full song. Even when looking at albums, I can't see the songs. I've used Spotify without premium before and it was not like this. Disappointing.",1
"It's free, but it's also a headache. I don't have reliable service all day, since Verizon has not improved for the last 15 years, so I download over wifi. Without service the app is basically useless. I think most apps have followed suit. Amazon Music, Audible, and now Spotify require data access even if the media is already downloaded. I use Podcast Addict now.",2
I am a Spotify user from a long time and even introduced it to many of my friends as it has lots of things which other music app does not but now it's annoying I am not able to play any song it ask for premium which is a basic thing in any music aap can't hear any song in a loop can't shuffle can't do anything I want after few songs there is add it just break the flow infact you can't even play the song from a specific time like if u wanna hear a particular line of any song you just can't.,1
"This app's volume is ridiculously low compared to other apps. The free version is so ridiculously terrible in playlist options and number of ads, that I'm better off using YouTube to make a playlist - YouTube's free version allows you to shuffle, doesn't keep trying to play songs you didn't ask for, and actually HAS all the music I want to listen to.",1
It's not giving forward option in spotify as if it is free. But long ago it's good and now ads are not coming in middle of songs but songs are playing little bit in middle of ads. Those many ads after every song. Just changing mood from listening song to uninstalling spotify. I would prefer minus rating if possible and actually this app doesn't worth for one star also,1
"1)Lyrics not loading at any point at all, having to fully uninstall the app and reinstall to remedy the problem, only for it to happen again, maybe a week or so later. 2)Podcasts not playing. I will click a podcast episode, and it will show 0:00 for both the current time and duration. I either have to update the app or uninstall and reinstall to fix it, only for it to happen again only DAYS later 3)Cannot figure out how to change/access account email There are more, but only so many characters.",1
"It used to like this app alot. It's so lack luster now and overpriced. They keep raising the price. The app keeps freezing up. I have to uninstall and reinstall. Sometimes that doesn't even work. It will randomly stop playing my music. I'm just going to go back to buying cds and uploading them to my computer, and just put them on my phone. Also the fact you only get 15 hours for audio books. Yeah I'm gonna get a library card and use Libby app. I'm tired of these companies b*llshit.",1
"I was listening to an audio book. I have 5 minutes left and it says I am out of listening time and I need to spend more money or wait until next month. Absolutely ridiculous!! If I can listen to endless music I should be able to listen to an entire story, no matter the length or month. I will most likely be canceling my Premium Duo subscription. This is very shameful and disappointing.",1
"I don't understand why increase the prices only to destroy the app. As a premium user, I shouldn't have to deal with things like Spotify messing up the order of songs on my playlists (when shuffle/smart shuffle are already disabled). Songs that were at the top of a playlist are missing, and some other songs end up on top. I remove those random songs one by one, only to have another random song automatically pop up in its place. Fix it soon or I'm unsubscribing!",1
"There's something wrong with my spotify. It doesn't load up my playlists when I'm offline even though I have premium and I downloaded all my playlists. However, now, my playlists won't show up at all. Even when I'm online! All it displays are my downloaded episodes and liked songs. What's wrong with your app? Are you trying to make it unusable? I spent money on it, and I'm not getting my money's worth.",1
"Whenever I try to make a playlist it starts playing a random song that I don't even want to hear, and I can't remove it or skip it. I can't even decide what part of the song I wanna listen, I need to listen through the WHOLE SONG for that one part. This is hideous and I hate the app. I love the lyrics and that but it's useless because it gives you limited skips and you can't listen to it offline😐",1
"Awful, offline mode still needs networking on, otherwise the app refuses to play downloaded playlists, and just hangs. Local files put into a playlist will occasionally be ""flagged"" in Spotify as not being valid and ignored in playlists, although they still play directly when not in a playlist. This then requires resetting the app, clearing app cache and files, and re setting up to see the flagged file as being valid again.",2
"Spotify is a pretty useful app and it's one of the best music apps out there, but the only reason why I rated 3 stars is because there is WAY to many ads. Between every 3 songs there's 5 unskippable 30 second ads, there's usually more ads than actual songs. Another problem I have is that the ""30 minutes of ad free listening"" is completely fake. I was just listening and I got a thing for 30 minutes of ad free listening but it only gave me 19",3
"This app sometimes play music. For money it is ok to add few ads in between songs but stopping necessary features for money and adding songs between ads is insane. It is the worst app. you cannot change songs ,cannot play what you want to hear. Downfall of the app starts the moment when they applied cheap tactics to force people to use premium. Please spotify at least bring all the important features it's a humble request.",1
"The update is so annoying. The smart suffle isn't even on. When I'm trying to listen to a specific artist, a song from another artist plays. Even when I'm playing my playlist, songs are playing even though they're not in my playlist. And when you add something to the queue, it's not playing. I even brought premium for the ads and now there's this bug. I listen to music to chill, not to get irritated.",1
"After an ad my music stops & I have to go & turn it back on. When I listen to an artist's (like eminem) playlist for too long, it will start playing trash music not even close to my music taste. I'll dislike it, but yet something similar plays next. There's only a certain amount of times you can dislike bc there's a limit on skips. I want to listen to Eminem & rap artists, not some awful country-jazz mix. I can't get back to rap until I close the app for 30+ minutes, which is annoying & stupid.",1
"Really you guys don't even deserve 1 star rating now. The free version of this app is of no use now. I can't rewind the song, your 'smart shuffle' don't let me listen the songs I want to. Its seems you're forcing us to buy the premium. Thankyou for atleast allowing us to pause and play the song. It was my favourite music app but now it just gives disappointment. With each and every update the app is just getting worse.",1
"Tried making the jump from iTunes to Spotify, but Spotify is so limited in how you can sort a playlist. I tend to sort playlists by the release date, which seems like a pretty simple thing to make available I dont understand why Spotify wouldn't provide such an option. *edit* And now they took away the like button. Not sure why this is so popular when it has so few feautres. Doesn't work well for audiobooks either. Local files have no option to jump 15 secs or save location along the listen.",1
"I use this app a lot, and I mean A LOT. I'm updating my review from 5 to 3 stars because one thing. I don't mind the ads (wich are a lot...) but recently I've noticed that in a lot of songs appears a message that says ""couldn't load the lyrics of this song"". I have a good Internet connection and it really bums me not being able to see the lyrics of a lot of songs.",3
"When i first bought Spotify, i discovered so much new music and also found so many older goldies that i had completely forgoten about. I absolutely loved id. But now, it feels like it has become Youtube 2.0. I get recommended the SAME songs everytime. EVERY SINGLE TIME the same songs in a row. No matter what i do. I play a song for the first time, I like it, i hope i get recomended some similar new music. Nope. Next on queue is the same song as before.Always. Not worth the money anymore.",1
"I love this app, which helps me find good music. The functionality is often altered with upgrades, which can be frustrating. This is especially true when it interferes with being able to edit my own play lists. They did seem to work out a few of the bugs following a recent update, so hopefully this is a sign of progress.",4
"I've used spoify for a while, but only recently have had one major problem with my playlist. Shuffle doesn't work properly anymore. I hit shuffle and it cycles through the same songs, and same order too. I logged out and in, but it did the same thing but with other songs, and automatically is off. I wish there is a way to make shuffling entirely random.",3
"Ever since they added this ""smart shuffle"" the app has had nothing but problems. I spend time creating my own playlists to listen to those specific songs. Then randomly without even touching my phone, smart shuffle turns on. For the love of God, add an option to have it turned off completely if the user wants that.",1
I own the premium ill say that outright. But lately while on data pr wifi when I enter spotify while its open in another tab it just closes out of what I was listening to. Often tells me there's no internet connection when im on unlimited data. I would hate to move money to another app but of you can't fix whats going on then ill take MY money elsewhere :) (update) music will no longer automatically play despite my settings saying so,1
"Podcasts don't work and support just passes me between people that tell me to do the same thing over and over. Edit: this response is the standard response from that email. I have restarted the device, re-installed the app and cleared the cache among other things that it suggested on their FAQ. Support passes me from one person to the next and they all ask me to log in again or restart my phone. They asked for more details but all the app tells me is that nope, not happening when I hit play. :(",1
Occasionally glitches fatally and won't let me access any songs and I can't do anything. Takes a while to fix and they currently haven't acknowledged it but when it does work it's very good. Update: my songs randomly swap places in the library and when I pur them back into their original spots it just swaps with another song. Fix your damn app spotify,3
"Too many ads, random unexplained price increases, free version claims to give 30 mins of listening between ads but actually gives 15 mins at most. If the price increase was to better pay their artists I wouldn't mind, but it isn't. Can't turn off Smart Shuffle, so my playlists are now pointless. No one wants random new songs thrown into a playlist they spent hours making.",1
"Spotify is a servicable app with a solid library of works I liked using. However, I absolutely despise their strategy when a user cancels their premium subscription which I am doing now. The fact that after cancelling, but before the premium runs out (so the app is still paid), I now have very annoying pop-ups in-app and rude e-mails asking me to reconsider, makes me never want to resubsrice. This UX element is hateful, among other new updates such as smart-shuffle and removing the like button.",2
I'd like to know is it that I'm unable to replay the song in my liked Playlist. It makes no sense. I'm listening to a song I really like but I'm unable to replay or pull the song back to my favorite part. And when I want to put a specific song on a constant loop I'm unable to. Seriously Spotify team I thought you could do better than this shame on you. Other than that problem which you should work on by the way. I really the app but you guy make want to rethink downloading it honestly.,2
"The new update made this app the worst. I was fine with the huge number of ads earlier, as long as I could play my playlists in order and loop a song and listen to as many songs as I liked, as long as I could have the basic features, I was fine with the huge number of ads. But the new update makes me want to throw this app into the trash. Y'all are basically telling us to pay or gtfo of your app.",1
"Going downhill fast. The only reason I still use this app is because there isn't much else. The new smart shuffle really annoys me because it will randomly turn on when I'm listening to my liked or another playlist. I don't want these random songs shoved down my throat when I specially choose a playlist. There used to be an ""enhance playlist"" button that let you choose if you wanted such additional content. Apparently Spotify has decided this wasn't enough and now forces this on us.",2
"App on android is underdeveloped and ignored. Devs don't care and have stopped trying. Will soon switch to another music service because spotify has been failing repeatedly for a while now. Smart shuffle is the most universally hated addition to spotify, and the fact they still won't let you disable it in settings shows how little they actually care about user experience.",1
"I am so confused about what does each symbol stand for. Ex., on the right side under where you have things listed, underneath there's like 4 tinyboxes. What does that do? I really wanted to make a full playlist for Pantera, starting with CFH cd and putting every album in order, it was impossible, because everytime I tried, another playlist would come down and not even the right band. From all I've read on here,I would highly recommend going back to the way it was before it became confusing. I wi",3
"I love love LOVE spotify and have been using it for YEARS, but i recently come to find that spotify has gotten buggy and also has been adding random songs to the start of my playlists. I dont know how or even if i CAN fix it, but it's really frustrating.. I love this app and do not at ALL want to give it up. But with recent activites, and the fact of that i can't just have my own playlists without spotify adding a song to the top of them that i don't think i can turn off. I've looked.",2
"It's an amazing app, and the premium is really good. The only thing I would say is bad with premium is the downloading. It takes a bit of storage depending on what you download, and sometimes, if it's downloaded, it doesn't even work. I've downloaded many things, but I can't always listen to them. Overall its a good app though.",4
What an awesome experience I'm having after purchasing premium on Spotify. It haven't even been two weeks and I am just so irritated. It took me more than two weeks to finally make my playlist on this app and now no matter how many time I hit shuffle button i am just unable to shuffle my own playlist this is just so irritating and awful. The only reason I bought this premium was bcz Resso was no longer in service but believe me that little app was thousand times better than this branded misery.,1
"Seriously! For the love of all that is holy! Stop playing another random podcast when my queue is empty! I'm getting really tired of having to remember to go into the app during the last podcast so I can set a ""sleep timer"" just so it won't keep running. This ain't rocket science. Do you guys even use your own app?",2
I don't know what the recent update did. But I can't play more than 30 seconds without it stopping. My headphones are fully charged. Not connected to any other device. I have a premium account and have had for years. Why am I getting gaps in my play to where I have to stop what I'm doing. Go into the Spotify app. Go to the song I'm playing push pause when it wasn't paused and then replay it? Why am I playing premium price for this error for the whole month?,3
"This app is getting worse. I loved Spotify, but that love is wearing thin. The app is getting really glitched out. I have to relike songs to confirm that I have them in my playlist, just to find they're listed 2 or 3 times in my library. Smart shuffle sends me songs that I already liked and that feature turns itself on. Shuffle isn't really shuffle. It sends me songs I like to listen to a lot rather than looking into my entire playlist. Im getting tired of the bugs, but my library is almost 3000",3
I would put it 5 stars but my music keeps pausing for no reason. I had to unpause 6 times in a 3 and a half minute song. I've done everything online and i don't know what else to do. This issue needs to be fixed. My internet is fine and the songs are downloaded to my phone. I don't understand why it's doing this. It's my main music app for work and just in general.,3
"I don't like this app very much at all. You have to pay for shuffle and if you want to skip more than six songs per hour. They keep adding songs to my playlist and I can't take them off and I can't skip past them because I don't have premium. I'll look up a song I've looked up before and it'll play a totally different song. The only reason I still have it, is because I use it as my ringtone to wake up in the morning and even that takes 5 minutes to set up every few nights. 0/10 do not recommend.",1
"I like the interface and the wide variety of music and small artists, but the ads are so excessive, its more like im listening to ads and then its interrupted by music, its ridiculous. I switch between playlists and an ad plays, one single song plays, and then i get jumpscared by an ad thats louder that the music itself.",1
"My downloaded playlists will indefinitely be in the load screen unless I connect to the internet briefly. I paid for the premium version to be able to listen to my music offline without problem, not like this! (Btw, already tried clearing cache, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, and it is has the problem).",1
"The app got rid of my first song on the list then start putting other songs. Then it got rid of the second song, it's fine on my ps5 but messed up on the phone. Try putting the songs back but it just keeps saying the song is already on the list. Basically the app is just deleting my music and I'm not paying for this subscription if it's not fixed. Not gonna lie, was over reacting when I found the songs through the list.",4
"Why can't I choose which song I want to listen to in my playlist. I can only listen to the preview if the song I click. Why is there a limit to how many skips I can do per hour?? On PC I have none of the these issues. All of these ""new features"" are incredible annoying I simply can't use the app.",1
This is World's best ever app to listen music but i have something bad news that is when I updated my Spotify then it getting error sometimes and I fell kind soo angery n the song is also started form beginning.. I hope u will fix this. And when I updated this app there is so amazing new features but when I wants to see the lyrics of any song there is no any lyrics of any song this happens in every song pls help mee..🥲🥲🥹,3
"I used to love Spotify and the shuffle feature worked fantastically for a long time. However, now it just plays the same 10 songs in the same order over and over and over. Not much of a shuffle feature for a playlist of over 350 songs. I'm canceling my premium membership and looking for a different music provider",2
"The app is great, but there is one problem I'd like addressed. I'm a podcast listener primarily and for some reason at times when I click a podcast to listen to it will ""play"" but wouldn't actually play anything. I'd restart my cell and it'd repair itself but now my favorite podcast just wont play at all. Yet, I can listen to every other podcast and Playlist I have. It's quite annoying not to be able to catch up with my weekly shows.",3
"I have the paid version and love the content! Can access all my favourite shows and songs, easy to create playlists, etc. I will say that a few months ago I was unable to play on my speakers AND use the timer. Not very convenient for listening to anything at bedtime. It used to never be an issue, so not sure why it is now.",4
"it's a great app overall, just annoys me with the shuffle, and how many ADS go into this platform, i used this app as long as i can remember, i would like to have less ad every time i try to click a song, and it keeps putting on random songs that are not in the playlist, it's quite infuriating since i usually want to listen to my own music that i have adjusted in the playlist, not play random suggested songs, overall great app",4
I love to listen to music but I'm about seriously done with this app. I've been a premium user for about 10 years and I'm tired of all the glitches and bugs and other issues this app CONSTANTLY goes through. The latest being my downloaded songs won't stay downloaded. All the money Spotify collects and this app stays with problems.,1
"Too many ads. I'll suffer more ads in a row than I get to listen to music. 30 minutes of free music is a lie. I've gotten 6-10 ads for every 3 songs max. It's ridiculous. Honestly Spotify is lucky it's one of the best music streaming platforms because it's ads bloody suck. Edit: it is now the end of 2023 and the ads have gotten worse. I can barely get 2 songs before I have ads. I do like the ability to.like or dislike ads, except it doesn't really do anything either.",3
"EDIT: I've had 4 years of ads on my premium account, and now after getting fed up with it, I complained once again, and now I'm banned. Spotify. When I pay for premium subscription, I expect premium features and not ads for the span of 4 years. Still getting ads with premium, also not accepting the school I attend that's on the list.",1
"Spotify getting worst,shuffling songs ,can't repeat,play nxt song Which is worst update of Spotify People are ok with adds in between but now can't play songs queue in our own playlists too.I think other apps don't do this Atleast aside of adds others provide Contionus songs without shuffling.So I think it's better shifting to other music app I mean who wants to buy 119 per month just for music? I means it's better we get YouTube or Hotstar premium we can watch movies/Videos .",1
"You guys are getting greedy every second! before the update,i can change the song whatever i want and have unlimited skips and when i play my playlist the songs that plays are in the playlist, now I can't change the song!?, it just pops in a different songs that are NOT in my playlist AND we can only skip 6 times if we don't have/ buy premium!? Please fix this...and Don't be greedy..",2
Spotify is premium is absolutely amazing however. if you don't have premium then it's one if not the worst music app you could use as there is just so many negatives 1. The fact you can't choose a song you have to make a playlist then shuffle 2. You can only preview a song for about 10 seconds 3. You can't skip songs go back to songs Spotify used to be good even for no premium users but now the amount of ads you get is crazy I listen to more ads then my own songs,2
"As someone who listens to music a LOT, I feel like I can say this app is amazing. I only have one issue: On some songs, it says that the lyrics aren't avalible. At first, I thought it was a problem with my wifi or that my app needed an update that I couldn't find. Then I learned, other people were having this issue too, and it wasn't just me. I like to look at the lyrics while the song plays, so this is a bit of an issue for me. This would be 5 stars if this didn't exist. Please fix this bug.",4
"5/11/21: It'd be nicer if it wasn't as buggy. Clicked to watch an ad for 30mins w/out. One song later I get three in a row. I'd pay for a membership to avoid them, if it wasn't for my other issue being it randomly pausing playback or flat out closing itself. 1/28/24 Update: And still this app will play an ad claiming to give me 30min ad free listening, just to play MORE ads after just one song. Pretty sure that counts as false advertising at this point.",1
"Super glitchy. And don't expect to listen to your downloaded music offline (even with a premium account) even if you set it up on the app ahead of time. Regarding Bluetooth using the app: it depends on the day if spotify will actually work, or if you will just have to search your favorite songs on YouTube. Making Playlists is probably easier on YouTube, on spotify half the time it brings you to home after adding one song to a Playlist. Or the app quits.",1
"I have given this app so many chances and it always fails. Controls are terrible, search is terrible, no access to your queue. I think the most ironic part is there is a line in the setting that reminds you to keep your eyes on the road but they make the controls or lack thereof so difficult to use. There is just a whole lot of dumb in the design of this app.",1
Hate to say it because I've never had any problems before but it keeps rearranging songs in my playlists which is really aggravating when I sort my playlists by album years and then when you go to move the song back to the place it was it puts a new random one as the first. Please fix this. I can not edit my playlists the way I want to like this.,1
"More features equals a more confusing interface. I loved this app, no longer 😞. My present beef is that starting listening to a playlist creates a quasi queue that then cannot be cleared, which is seriously annoying on Android Auto when the music plays whenever I start the car. Please let me clear the playback of playlists without playing something else. And yes, I have reinstalled the app.",2
"I haven't had a complaint in my nearly 5 years of using Spotify, but recently the app will randomly stop playing for no reason. It wasn't a massive issue until it started happening every 5-10 minutes which is really annoying when I am trying to study and have to keep stopping to re-open the app.",3
"Would be okay, lots of songs not available, but THE MOST annoying thing is it CONSTANTLY shuts down on you, you have to reopen and restart the song that was almost over when it shut down. Idk what they're doing over there but this needs to be fixed. I got premium and I am thinking of cancelling it because of this VERY annoying issue.",3
"The app is good but faces annoying end user issues. 1. Playback stops when switching between non shuffle, regular and smart shuffle. 2. The playlist resets to the beginning when switching between devices. 3. Shuffle in general does not work. I expect shuffle to have different order out of 200 tracks but ends up picking the same 20.",2
It used be good but now they are using every method to make it the worst music app. Can't reverse the song can't even play a selected song after some time . Sometimes random songs start to while i am listening to the my playlist then wtfck i made a playlist in the first place if i wanted to listen to random songs . I guess time to switch .,1
"When I used it like 4 years ago it was brilliant but now for every single small function it saying ""premium membership"" The are many reasons I hate this app 1. I can't forward or backward the songs 2. My playlists are always in ""smart shuffle"" 3. I can't sometimes see the lyrics of a song 4. And most importantly, the ads like, why 4 ads for 1 song.",1
"I love this app,Unlike other music apps,Spotify, have songs from big, and litte artists! If you are trying to find a song,you can find it, and if wanting to,there are more, and diffrent copies of the song you are looking for!, and if you arent in the mood for songs,you can find some,and likable podcasts! I listen to Spotify daily,and enjoy it. Execpt the ads, there isnt, and arent any downfalls of Spotify. 100/10",5
"I really wish that the username settings could be changed on Spotify. I've seen lots of comments about this, how many have for example their ex-spouse's last name as their Spotify username, or just a full name they don't go by anymore. Being able to change your username on Spotify would be really important, so creating new accounts just for a new username wouldn't be necessary and people could feel comfortable with sharing their account.",3
"Enjoying the new dj function. However, there are points where it will randomly stop or not function properly. It's not my big issue. My big issue is the same songs being forced to play despite skipping them repeadidly. Add an option to remove a song from rotation on DJ or the ability to remove artists entirely from the music rotations would help make it feel better when being shown new music knowing something you really dislike will not be coming back.",4
"SO BUGGY since the update 12/2023! I clear my cache, restart my phone, force stop... STILL freezes up. Samsung S22 Ultra. For what I pay for this app, it should run 100%. So frustrating! Edit: downgraded to 1 star after Jan'24 update left app just as unusable as before. Frozen in whatever the last thing I listened to >24 hours ago. Can't connect to Bluetooth. I shouldn't have to clear my cache/force stop every single time I open the app. The issue appears to be mainly with BT.",1
"I've been using Spotify for almost 10 years now, for the past 2 or 3 years there's been a glitch where after I shuffle my playlist and customize the shuffle for the songs I want to play first. Every single time without fault the app reshuffles my music to a random selection, when clicking play I use the music bar at the bottom of the screen, I do not click the green shuffle button. I pay a premium for this application after my sub expires I'm moving to YT music, u care nothing for your customers",1
"New update starts to hang and lag or won't even connect to the internet. when it starts to hang it also affects other apps. When it's closed, all other apps working fine. I have android 12 with 16gb of ram and 128gb rom. It hangs alot more when I'm using data (checked the internet speed and it's basically the same with the wifi).",2
Can't login in...payed for a subscription and all I get is something went wrong...was working fine till I put money in it...I restarted my device..checked to see if they're might be an update version...nothing and still can log in....I have to have my music for my ptsd so thank you Spotify I haven't had music in a week now!!!! And you have to log in just to get help.....,1
"Spotify is a good app, but it needs improvements. We need the ability to: •Click 'Play next' or 'Play last' for a song, not only 'Add to queue' •Listen to a song/songs that were added to queue, once it moves to the next song, we can click the arrow to go back and it plays to the song/songs we added to queue, not a random song within the playlist we are playing. •Shuffle our queue. •Download specific songs without having to add them to a downloaded playlist.",3
"Very good quality, great for making playlists and finding songs. However, sometimes the same ad will play two/three times in a row and it's so irritating, also one feature I absolutely hate is when you're trying to listen to your own playlists and it makes you listen to 'suggested songs', you could use all your free skips and still not be able to listen to the songs you want to. Very frustrating.",3
"Awesome, honestly. But I've come to be annoyed by the amount of ads. It's every 3-4 songs when I get an ad, and I keep getting a cat-food ad, and even though I've disliked the ad and said I was getting it too often, I keep getting it. And second problem: when I try to play one song by searching it up and clicking on it, it goes to a relevant song, but not the same song I wanted to listen to. Other wise, great app!",4
"I love the app, but now this thing of choosing a track for me, I don't understand it. If I press on 'Track A', why on earth would you play me 'Track C'??? I've been with Spotify for 4 years now. Going Premium and back. But now this? You're trying to force users to go Premium, and honestly, that is just unappealing 👎. Also, why should we get ""limited skips"" per hour?🙄 You're ruining things.",1
"I love spotify, i will always use it for my music. But oh my god, i get like over 6 ads before i play any song. And with the new updates, i cant even choose the song i wanna play from my playlist. I also cant put it on repeat or add songs to my quene. I think we should be able to do these things without having to throw out some money. Just go back to the old spotify where we can choose our own songs and only have like 1-2 ads before having 30 mintues ad free ❤",3
"Vertical video feed is terrible. If there's no way to disable it, I have no choice but to find a different music player. *Edit* I reverted to an older version as a workaround. And I'm sick of Joe Rogan's conspiracy-peddling podcast showing up as a suggested podcast. Spotify shouldn't give a platform to disinformation. At least give me the option to block him from my suggestions.",1
"I've used spotify for years and has been my go to music app for a long time. However, I hate the new like button thing. It makes things a lot more complicated. It can be confusing as well, as sometimes I'll just be adding songs to a playlist that were reccomended for that playlist so I can see what those songs are like, however it adds the checkmark thing so I get confused as to weather I liked the song or not. Also, I liked the little heart icon. I miss the old like button.",3
"I love music so much, I dont think I could survive without it. however I have just one or two complaints with Spotify. first, of course, is ads. so annoying, that I get the same ads every time. also, I get about 4 ads, 3 if I'm lucky, with only two songs in between every ad break. this is the absolute worst thing ever and I hate it so much 😭 second, the newest updates take away the like button, and the way playlists are set, you can't add the same song more than once to a playlist :( please fix",3
"Probably the best music streaming service out there. I have it installed on multiple devices, but it seems to be working not as intended on the samsung galaxy tab 9, given that it takes a long while and a few restarts of the app for it to finally start working. Not to mention the occasional crashes. Apart from that, Spotify is an easy recommendation for all music listeners.",5
"Alright. Spotify, cool, great, I love my music. BUT GOD. it's getting infuriating that 9 out of 10 times whenever i open the app, it just doesn't respond, crashes randomly, or doesn't even work correctly. And the insane amount of ads every 5 seconds whenever I do finally get it to work is NOT FUN. I've done everything to fix the crashing and nothing seems to be working. So yeah, that's just. Great. Awesome.",2
"Not sure what's going on lately, but it's getting more and more annoying. I can barely ever listen to an entire album or playlist, as about 3-5 songs in, it gets in a weird bugged state. It shows the next song is playing, but there is no sound at all, and the bug is obvious as the play time counter just keeps going on into infinity, even past the song's length. To fix it, I manually have to either move a track forward or back, or tap on the seekbar. Please fix, it's a horrible experience.",2
"Dropped my review from a 3 to a two. I understand that premium is the way to go for the app but at least make the app enjoyable for us free users. I get ads after every song and it's very annoying. I wouldn't mad an ad or two after a few songs, but every time I skip a song or chose a playlist I get ambushed with multiple ads. I tried reinstalling the app to see if there would be any changes made, but it remains the same. I really love the app and I don't wish to switch to another music source.",2
"I'm not sure what happened with the recent update. Takes a long time for music to sync up. You go offline for a minute, and the whole app stops working. That never used to be the case, as the app usually synced up a couple of songs in advance. Seems like this is longer the case. Also, in offline mode, the whole app bugs out, I need to restart app several times or flip between the playlist for it to play my downloaded album.",2
"Great app, been using it for a while. The main thing I have an issue with, are the ads. They are literally unbearable now. It totally ruins the mood and ambience and shows another ad after the 'watch this video to get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening'. Ridiculous ! Anyways, would be amazing if Spotify could go a little easy on the advertisements. Edit: the updated free version absolutely sucks now. It was fine at first, but no replaying the same song ? No thank you.",1
"Premium account. Android Auto. It is a real disaster for the driver: 1. If you have no display like in tesla, the buttons are too small. 2. Buttons are not always in the same place. I think mainly about ""+"" that will add the song to liked songs. It is really annoying while diving. 3. Search results - a few first songs are relevant, but later, they play something different. 4. Safety doesn't permit lyrics in Auto mode, but no problem if you crash while trying to find options in the messy menu.",1
"love the app, there's a lot of possibilities even without the premium version, and the ads aren't really disturbing. however, there's something I'll ask y'all to fix, and I don't know if I'm the only one, but whenever i listen to music and start going on some other apps, the music stops playing suddenly. it's really pissing me off, so please fix it as soon as possible!",3
"It is completely impossible to listen to an album on the free version. I don't mind the adds or the random songs. But STOP putting suggested songs whenever I try to listen to an album. And if I skip that song, then another suggested song plays, and this goes on forever. If I try to play a different album instead, another suggested song will play. For the love of god, let me listen to the albums I choose to listen, I don't need suggestions. Turning suggestions off on the settings doesn't work.",1
"I REALLY don't like that the heart has been removed fully in this most recent update. I rely heavily on the hearts being next to songs. I can go to any album or playlist and easily see what my favorite songs are. Now I have to go through multiple steps to figure it out, even having to flip back and forth between two pages to cross reference when I never had to before. And the simplicity of being able to like any song in just one click without having to be actively playing it is lost. Bad change.",2
"This was the vero good app for listening your favorite music before. But after the update this has become the worst. 3 to 4 adds after listening only 3 songs, can't play the song in between, can't listen only the favorite part of the song, your chosed songs also doesn't play in line and etc etc. All this just to take the premiums 🤯. I hav not deleted this app hoping for the good results. But all in vain. Now I am deleting this app. Hope they will change and make it as it was earlier. 🙂",1
"For me, it was my all time favorite music app. But, after a new update, I started to see like we can't rewind, can't play a specific portion of the song or play any songs at any time. The solution of all these problems is to get Premium in any manner. It's unfortunate that an app called Spotify is charging us in all the manner though used to free and the subscription was voluntary.",1
"I got 9 ads in a row (i counted), then listened to 2 songs. I keep getting the same ad for some university, and though I repeatedly dislike it, it shows up again and again. the new update is slowly taking away song lyrics. There's now a stupid ""smart shuffle"", where spotify randomly inserts songs that aren't on my playlist but ""match the vibe"". I want to listen to MY music, not whatever you consider good. the only reason i havent switched to another app yet is because there are few alternatives.",1
"Spotify used to be ok, but now it's terrible. First problem I have, is it will give an ad and a message saying I'll get the next 30 minutes of music ad-free. But literally after the 1st or 2nd song, I'll get an ad. And it's not just 1 or 2 ads anymore. I've gotten up to 4 ads in between almost EVERY SONG. This used to be a great app, but now I can't listen to music without a million ads. And, a song will randomly pause for no reason. Sometimes it restarts the whole song.",1
"It has a lot of great features for discovering songs and making playlists. I don't like the new explore shuffle option. It keeps causing delays when I'm trying to turn off shuffle. Also, the new home page is difficult to navigate. Edit: they did improve on the shuffle function to take dramatically less time to load in and is easier to tap past now.",4
"This again! It had this a couple of years ago and now it's back! Options are remove it from lock screen completely or have it there 100% of the time. It's really irritating. It's useful on the lock screen when playing music but when not, it's constantly there. No matter how many times I close the app, clear the cache or dismiss it, it immediately returns. You're supposed to learn from mistakes not repeat them Spotify FFS.",1
"Lately, constant pauses and lags when listening to music, no matter on a mobile device or on a laptop. It's definitely not the Internet, it's fast and other services (e.g. Youtube) work perfectly. UPDATE: And now device synchronization doesn't work. Now on all my devices the music plays independently, the devices do not see each other, and I cannot, for example, from my phone, change the song that is playing on my laptop. The app keeps getting worse and worse, disappointing.",1
😑It's so disgusting..!! If we don't want to take premium then why should you force us to do so.!? The new features are really so disappointing. We can't change songs as per our preference.. We can't skip songs too..😑 The old version was best. No doubt that some new features are useful but some are not and in 1 hour we can skip songs only 6 time..! I suggest you to make the things as it was thus because of that reason I am rating 1 star..! Sorry to say but the changes are not so satisfying.,1
"Spotify used to be my go-to music streaming platform. I used to listen to spotify all the time. I've been a freemium user ever since, and even though there were always many ads, they were tolerable. At least I was getting the basic features one would expect a music streaming service to offer, but now, I can't even skip to a specific part of a song, can't even replay the same song, shuffle or order my queue anymore. Sure spotify has an unsustainable business model. It's completely unusable now.",1
"Good for music, if you know what you want to listen to. Shuffle doesn't always work; except for when it sometimes does always work, even when it's off. Music suggestions are usually hit-or-miss; more misses than hits. Lots of sifting to do when exploring. Ads aren't awful, but the app is practically useless without Premium. Has become predatory over the years. Guard your wallets.",2
"What happened? This used to be THE BEST music streaming app hands down. Now it crashes constantly, and it randomly stops playing and jumps back to the beginning of whatever I was listening to. I only gave it 4 stars because I've had it for years, and until now, no other services could even touch it. Based on the recent problems, it would honestly be a 1 star rating. I pay for the premium, but I won't for very much longer if the issues persist. It all started when the ai stuff was added.",4
"Adpocalypse; It used to be my favorite music app, but apparently they're determined to push their paid version. Hadn't used it in a while for tunes. Just Rogan and podcasts like that. Those are fine. However, when playing music it will literally play 2, maybe 3 songs then 4 ads. Really makes for an annoying experience, especially since it is the same ads over and over. Also, I'm really tired of it restarting every time I start my car. Even when I'm not using it and the app is closed.",1
"I love the Spotify service and have been paying for premium for years now. However, the app is tempermental and I have to uninstall and re-download at least twice a year mainly because the shuffle function is so glitchy. Playlists will often reshuffle themselves, the ""smart shuffle"" function is so annoying and sometimes won't turn off, and most recently, when I use the app in the car it will automatically start playing the last playlist played even if I've already queued up a new one.",2
"It's mostly great, but... Android app has hiccups; while streaming in the car, some tracks don't play, and i have to manually skip until something plays. 2nd, there's a device limit i keep running into, and there's no way for customers to manage that. 3rd, some of my playlists have duplicates of the exact same song - no biggie, but annoying to keep trimming them off. Lastly, the app is getting too cluttered. It's time for a UX rehaul. Other than that, i really like Spotify.",3
"Spotify has been such a great music app for me in the nearly five years I've been a premium member. As someone who travels alot, I use offline mode alot, with a large playlist of thousands of songs downloaded, and sorted into different playlists I like. Thats been fine, and the offline system was great and fine. However, recently, it feels like Spotify offline mode has changed, and when in offline mode, my playlists will not load at all, and frankly, it sucks. Please revert it back, and fix it.",3
"If you're using the free version, it's almost unusable. You can't turn off shuffle, the ads are NONSTOP, and you can't choose what songs you want to listen to. With premium, which is $10 a month, it's tolerable, and actually has some genuinely cool features like Spotify enhanced and DJ AI. I listen to a lot of music so it happens to be worth it for me, but if you don't wanna pay, use SoundCloud or Pandora, not this.",3
"Not convenient for general users (users with no subscription). You can not play the song of your choice from playlists, also you can not forward or rewind to a specific time. Also the frequency of ads have now become annoyance. They are taking the advantage of peoples' attachment to their own playlists and saved playlists, it is hard to let go of them and switch to other app.",1
"I use this app for yoga playlists. Which has always worked great. However, recently, the option to add a song more than once to a playlist has been removed. I used this option to double up on a song at the end of a playlist when coming into relaxation, so that the song faded, and started over. Will it be coming back as an option Spotify??? Please 🙏",4
"I have only a couple of things I wish were added, customization and a couple songs, but other than that it's great. I'd like for yall to remove some replicas of certain songs, and don't change the songs entirely to other versions of that song when we've already added them to our playlist over copyright. It's really annoying. Keep what we've added the same. (Great app overall seriously.)",4
"After being updated, this app has become very useless. Neither can you skip the song nor can you listen to your favorite part again, plus these ads spoil the whole mood. Lots of ads after every song. Sometimes the song gets played outside the playlist, now I can't even see the lyrics of the song on my phone. And I can't get my old account back either.I can't get Spotify Premium because I'm a student and my family won't allow it. Now I'm tired of this, I'm going to delete this app.",1
"The app is great. Areas of improvement--There should be better ways to limit explicit junk that comes up in searches. A Radio Version setting would be awesome. The Car Mode setting is terrible and nobody uses it. Even after setting it to Never turn on, Spotify (or an update) occasionally turns it back on and I have to waste my time turning it back off to get back to the proper view. Thanks for any remedies.",3
"It used to be the best app. Music, podcast everything used to be so good. But with each update the app keeps getting worse than before. The app transformed from best to worst. They're literally forcing people to get premium. The basic features of every music app is premium in this app. You can't rewind or replay any song. You can't play your playlist in order. There's not even a proper shuffle of your playlist, other songs just pop up outside from your playlist.",1
"This would've been 5 stars, but ever since the newer updates, the ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" became a false statement, and right after 1 song, I get another add. Not to mention, when I click ""shuffle"" on a playlist, it plays the same songs even if it's a 5-hour playlist. The only good thing about the app is that it has almost every artist, a wrap, and it can be listened to without the app being open.",3
"The app essentially no longer works. I pay for premium and I cannot use the app outside of my house or work. It's especially bad in the car, in which Spotify will freeze and stopped playing what I was listening to. When at home or at work, it frequently skips random parts of podcast episodes. This has been happening for several weeks and has progressively gotten worse. I've tried other apps, like Patreon and YouTube, and have had no issues. It is all Spotify specific.",1
"Disgusting.. I must admit that I am disappointed with the recent update. It seems that the app has transitioned into a paid version, as I am now unable to skip songs, select specific songs from my playlist, or even rewind a song if I want to replay a particular section. This lack of functionality is quite frustrating. Additionally, I am unable to switch off shuffle mode, further adding to my dissatisfaction... and even the number of adds is now 2 from 1 and very frequently",1
"I really love Spotify, and it has been my top listening app for over 8 years now. My only quarrel with the app is the new add button that replaced the like button. I have a hard time adding and removing songs, and for a while when I checked the add button the song I had selected was not added to my liked songs at all. I really wish the feature would have been separated from the liked button, instead of consolidating two features. Overall, still a good app.",4
"Excellent if you're subscribed, but the free version needs help. They recently changed the way the free app works, now you can actually pick what song you want to listen to, but otherwise shuffle will always be on. The real issue now though, is the ads that play would constantly break the app. I found myself deleting and re installing Spotify several times a week to fix it, as that was the only solution I came to. Otherwise subscribing is still great with a wide variety of songs and podcasts.",4
"Excellent so far, and I'm finding it simple to use. I usually search for music but did find a playlist that really suits my tastes. Keep up the good work! There is a new, very annoying feature now though. If I listen to an album it doesn't finish at the last track. The album plays from the beginning again, and that's with autoplay off.",4
"After the most recent update, this app is horrible. Whenever I open it, the splash page will open up some kind of sponsored album, I assume, but it's completely blank and there is no ""X"" to get rid of it. I have to use the phone back button to get rid of it. It will also do this randomly when I'm scrolling through a playlist or podcast episode list. It's infuriating.",1
"If you are using the free version, the ads never end. I frequently receive six 30s ads in a row, get to listen to one song, and then receive three more ads. I believe I spend 60% of my time on this app listening to nothing but ads. Music quality is good, but I also wish I could replay songs; go back to a previous song; and searching for songs were better. Overall, the app has good intentions, but you might as well buy premium if you even want the app to be usable.",1
"The worst experience ever after the update....WHAT is going on with the app.....you can't listen to specific part of the song, can't loop the long,can't listen to the previous song and worst can't even listen to songs in your choice of order. On top of that it feels like you are going to listen to the adds and not the music. Tbh I won't be using this app anymore if it does not get better. I don't have the patience to deal with it. Really want spotify to look into this situation asap",2
"Has been a great app to play music on and have had it for several years now. I've never had problems this often just things like the music would cut off out of no where or wouldn't play at all. Now ever since the new update I can't even get into the app and it stays on the logo instead of even trying to load. I've tried shutting it off and everything else but no. As well as that, spotify blocks songs or simply doesn't produce them (even though you can find them on other music apps)for no reason",4
"Spotify used to be a great app for listening to music... But then with the update, the ads have increased manifold, and the features! Oh my god, it's a nightmare. Can't play specific bits of the song, can't fast-forward, can't play playlist in the given order (Spotify's got a sneaky way of saying that randomisation is better)... Seriously, who puts such basic features under premium? Spotify should get it rectified, or it's actually gonna lose a bunch of customers.",1
this app used to be my all time favorite in which i used to play the songs i loved repeatedly without any interruptions but now it has gotten so worse that it went to the point where you cannot even choose to play the songs you want to more than 5 or 6times. The app itself chooses to play a song for you from outside your playlist or liked songs. Another thing is that you cannot play a song's specific part. For that you have to take premium. Like for every thing there's premium noww. Fix it.,1
"No replays, no slide-seek, and I can't listen to the songs on a playlist in order either. BUT there's even more. There's only a limited number of times I can actually listen to a song I select, per day. If I click on a song Spotify will literally not let me listen to it without premium. A limited number of skips per hour too, to add to the shittiness of their ""smart shuffle"". With all due respect, which is none at all, this app has become complete garbage.",1
"I've stopped using it ever since the new update. Can't have more than 6 skips, can't skip back, the (not so) ""smart"" shuffle and you can't even play the songs you search for. Utterly useless. You can't skips lyrics or even see the lyrics at all. I don't understand why premium is required for everything. This ain't no apple music. It used to be my favorite, however, now I barely use it. I bet there will be a day where you'll need premium to even open the app.",1
"I can't believe that I was pushed to a point where I'll have to buy premium. I've been using Spotify for years together and I have so many playlists that I've created over the years, that I can't lose. Things were already a bit annoying with the frequency of the ads increasing, but the recent update has gone too far. Not being able to repeat or shuffle is a pure evil move by Spotify to push users like me to buy premium. I'm migrating all my playlists and uninstalling this app for good 🫡",1
"From an Android developer: This app is very bad on my tablet. It will regularly stop playing music in the background, and then freeze. When I close it and reopen it, it almost always takes several attempts to actually open. It will occasionally produce an ANR on app startup. I love Spotify, and it works well on my iPhone, but there are problems with the Android app that seem to be recent. Please contact me if you need help debugging. Im a long time user, and I want to see this get resolved.",1
"Been using Spotify for years together, but after their recent update... I can't believe that I'm unable to do anything on my list anymore. I can't choose or skip songs, I can't listen to what I want to, I mean this entirely defeats the whole purpose of having a musical app. Never thought, would rate it 1 star. After this update the no. 1 music app is gonna fall down the charts very soon",1
The worst app. It was the best before the update. You only get 6 skips per hour and you can't skip a song to a specific part. Spotify was my happy place after a long and tiring day but now it's totally changed! You can't do anything if you don't have premium! And the amount of adds are unbelievable! It's like I'm hearing to adds instead of songs! So disappointed in you Spotify.,1
"Worstt application... Can't play anything without getting stuck with stupid features. Can't rewind, fast-forward, can't play the song from the desired part, can't play on repeat. You REQUIRE to BUY the subscription in order to unlock even the basic features. Annoying Frustrating and totally useless. It was the best music application before the latest updates.",1
"The app is good although it has its flaws. Sometimes the music stops playing for no reason or the app takes more than 5 minutes to open and then it just crashes. And then the ads... Oh my god, it's the most irritating thing ever, literally 4 ads appear in a row after listening to just 3 songs. I'm supposed to be able to go 30 minutes without ads, it doesn't even seem like I can reach 10 minutes without getting atleast two ads. It's very annoying.",2
"Love the spotify app. Been using it since 2013 but in the past 2 days I can't use it at all. It keeps telling me I am offline which I am not then it just loads and loads and nothing happens, some times it crashes. Also, I usually fly for work and when I go to offline mode the past couple weeks it hasn't been working. It plays 2 or 3 songs then it stops. I pay a monthly subscription and the app has not been working the past 2 days. Can someone please fix this???",1
"Hi, I've been using Spotify for the past 2 years now, and I really liked it. But making one big mistake can ruin all the good things you've done, and that's exactly what happened here. It turned TOO COMMERCIAL. I'm not lying when I say I got ads EVERY 1 MINUTE, and it used to be so long. They disabled many features. Now I can't even choose what song I want to play next, and if I want to choose, they say ""upgrade to premium"". This takes away the whole music listening experience. Please rectify it",1
"What on earth is this? The newest update is absolute garbage. You can't play songs in a specific order, you can't rewind any part in a song, you can't fast-forward to a specific part....what is this?! On top of that, spotify doesn't even play the next song in a specific playlist, just jumps to something random. I've gotta say, the newest update has ruined everything.",1
The app frequently won't play songs or podcasts. I'm not exactly sure what causes it but I think it might have something to do with Bluetooth and having spotify on pause. The app won't play music or podcasts even if I have them downloaded. I have to force stop the app in my phone settings just so I can play the media. It is really annoying and I need this fixed ASAP.,2
"It's mediocre, they're constantly adding more and longer ads. To the point where your almost always asked to watch an ad to listen to anything or after every other song. And if you decline it just gets shoved in two songs later. I don't have a problem with most ads but the problem is that they're becoming considerably more frequent, longer and repetitive. I'd rather pass on premium if this is how they treat base level. Even got me to move to Amazon Unlimited once I did want to pay.",1
"The free version is just radio. You can't pick your music, it chooses for you. The ads are invasive. 1 ad for 30 minutes? How about an unskippable 15-second ad every time you open a menu. Ridiculous. As much as people hate SoundCloud, you don't have to pay for basic features such as a repeat button or opening a Playlist. I'm gonna go back to downloading mp3s on bandcamp, at least then my money goes towards paying the artist. You guys suck.",1
"Customer service is non-existent. I would think a premium subscription would eliminate advertising pop ups, but it does not. I have tried rectifying this ongoing issue with customer service, on numerous occasions, but they are unable and or unwilling to address the advertising pop ups. Moreover, notification settings seem to be for show and do not work. All notification settings are turned off, yet I still receive an advertisement pop up nearly each time I open the application. Why?",1
"I am not sure what you guys are doing to the app. I've had an account for ten years and recently has the experience gone so downhill. App constantly crashes. If I open the ai dj, then try to play anything other than the dj, the app crashes until i completely reinstall the app. If you can fix whatever the issues have been lately, I will go back to thinking this is the greatest music service. I'm only staying a subscriber out of my loyalty for the great product you have had for many years.",4
"Edit: I did reinstall before writing the review, and it kept crashing. I wasn't impressed as I'd had such good service for the last 7 or 8 years. Although the app has stopped crashing I hope it doesn't happen again. This app used to be a great platform...now it randomly closes down and won't open again for a few hours. Thinking of ending my subscription if this carries on!",2
"Overall a great experience. Having a premium account definitely adds to the experience. Certain features I would love to see added across platforms (you can't ""dislike"" a song on PC, for example). To add onto that, I would like to see an easier way to dislike songs, as i often get recommended songs I do not like and the way to remove them is quite tedious in my opinion. However, I would still strongly recommend to friends, and it is one of the best platforms for listening to music offline.",4
"I've had this app for many many months, maybe almost a year. I love using this app except for the last few days. It won't play a song in full, it will crash several times. And the song tends to kick in when I am on the app, if I'm lucky. I have uninstalled and reinstalled this app yesterday Saturday evening. And now, Sunday morning, with songs crashing, not playing in full. As I type this, there goes another song, crashing and I never paused it. Don't want to switch apps, help solve the issue.",2
"I use it primarily for podcasts and it works great. My biggest contention is I listened to a podcast and subscribed to it for a month and decided I didn't like it, and it keeps returning. I have tried a lot on the mobile app and I can't permanently stop it or block it. All in al outside of the minor inconvenience, it's good. No skipping/jumping or problems and it runs smoothly.",4
Tried customer support. No help. Still doing it. Would give it 0 stars if thst was an option. Came back to Spotify after 3 months. Still randomly stops. Can't though a song. Thank God for Pandora and Sirius! Worked great but recently it stops playing at random times. I can barely get through 2 songs before the music stops and I have to reopen app and start again. If this happens in the middle of the song and I have to reopen the song starts at the beginning and not where it left off.,1
I think a lot of us are only still using Spotify because we've been using it for years and are comfortable with it. But with every update it becomes worse. The changes are worse. The recommendations are irrelevant and the search feature is useless. Don't even get me started on the artist-music mismatches that go unfixed. Forget about ads- I'd pay to have the old Spotify back.,3
"Amazing apo, there's no way I could live without it. The premium version is definitely worth it. I would have given it 5 stars, but recently, the app is freezing, not playing songs that are downloaded, closing by itself, and the DJ for 2023 glitches and keeps you from using the app. I had to go to another device to make it play something else just to get one device working again. The app is definitely experiencing quite a few bugs right now. Once the app is normal again, it's definitely a 5.",3
"The application is ok. However, almost every album that has only a remastered version available is unlistenable to me. And this is the case with many popular music albums. My assesment of the platform would favor it significantly more if it provided access to the original editions. As it is, I don't feel I can honestly recommend it to those who love music for the music, without any caveat. On the plus side there are baroque, renaissance and classical albums to enjoy. So that's great!",3
"I don't even remember how many years it been since i started using Spotify. it was the best music app out there, i was the one who introduced Spotify to many of my friends to find unlimited songs with best experience for students like us. the ads was annoying but it was okay. but now this app is only for premium users, you could've just told us to get out from your high and mighty platform. wish you would have thought of us before doing this. I guess loyalty doesn't mean much to you, does it?",1
"i just bought premium and it made my life easier! i love the simple and minimalist look of the app. it definitely has room for improvement. i would really appreciate if you guys would look into adding more features such as: 1.) being able to download the lyrics, 2.) can select multiple songs to add/remove from a playlist, 3.) unlike all liked songs / have a select multiple feature also. i feel like spotify would be easier to use with more features! love the app.",3
"Love Spotify, but there are some bugs that need to be fixed asap. For instance music will be playing, but will not show on my phone(it'll say Spotify is trying to play...), when on the app, or across the bottom of the Spotify screen and therefore it will not cast on my car's screen. I have to shut the whole thing down and open back up which is not great to do while living in a ""hands-free"" state. Also my liked songs regularly disappear. The platform should be able to keep up",4
"Everyone seems to be complaining about ads or music stopping, but my issue is the app not loading. I recently got Spotify premium too, so I don't want to waste it. I'm going to try reinstalling it and I'll update my review if it works! Update: It worked the first time, but when it started happening again, the second reinstall didn't work, with several reopens. Update: It actually began to crash now, instead of staying open. The loading is fixed, it just crashes whenever I open it now.",2
"I love this app, I use it daily, and I don't have to worry about it constantly loading lol. Though, I don't understand why it's so necessary to punish the people who aren't paying premium, with 6 (give or take) different adds after 3 songs. It's so annoying, and it's unfair to me. Update: Anytime I have Spotify playing, and I'm on another app it decides to cut off and I have to go back and reply the whole entire song over again, and most of the times it does it more than once with the same song",2
"After being a great app for several years Spotify has a very difficult time downloading my playlists. It begins downloading and freezes after a short while. I've already gone through all troubleshooting steps. Fresh install, fully updated, premium membership, solid internet connection, plenty of space on my phone, switched a bunch of settings off and on again, etc. The developers need to fix their app or else I'll be returning to the mp3 era.",1
"I've used Spotify for years, and been generally happy with it (although dumping Heavyweight is a MAJOR mistake, but that's another issue). But I'm writing about a technical issue; in the last six months, the app has been crashing, restart works, but it's gradually happening more often, and lately takes several restarts. I know I'll soon have to delete and reinstall, my question is, is there a way to save my history, preferences etc, or do I have to start from scratch? p.s. Heavyweight? Rly?",4
"Just unsubscribed from the premium plan. This app is so unbelievably glitchy. It's not even funny. I used to be able to play spotify in my car with Bluetooth. As soon as I turned on the radio with bluetooth, it would play the last thing I was listening to. Now it doesnt play anything and when I try to open the app, the app just shows a dark frozen screen until I turn off my radio, and restart the app. And today it doesnt want to play on my phone at all. Every update comes with problems.",1
"Spotify was genuinely one of the best music app but it's so disappointing how worse it has gotten. We can't skip the song, play what we want to after a particular period of time, see the lyrics, play a particular part. One can't listen to music properly anymore....I don't SUGGEST Spotify to anyone anymore. Ads were better than all of the changes they have made..",1
Absolutely amazing. All the songs that I could possibly want! (I have the premium plan) Edit: I would love it of there was a bug report button or page IN THE APP ITSELF because lately I've been having some pretty big issues. Here are a few of them. my audio will cut out mid song. All of my music will delete and redownload which uses A LOT of my data. I'm not sure if this is a bug but downloaded playlists will take forever to load in. I would put a few more but I'm running out of characters.,4
"You all NEED to cut down how many ads there are, and there are too many features to pay for. Literally, the only things that you should have to pay for are no ads' unlimited skips and downloads, and maybe peaking at the next song but not unable to have your playlist in the order you want, and being able to press a song and it actually play and not a preview of it. Well, besides all that, it's a pretty good app.",4
This app used to be wonderful. It had a fair amout of ads and good selection of songs. But then it started glitching and lagging a few days ago. I just got a new phone so I don't think that's the issue. But after the glitch was over it started playing 3 to 4 ads after each and every song! It's extremely annoying! Also the new update is absolutely disgusting.,1
"I really love this app. It would get 5 stars if we were able to customize the home screen. I want to choose what stays there and what it looks like (back ground colors, arrangement, which playlist/podcast, etc.) having a favorite friend or playlist would be nice too. Also, allowing users to change the image for blends would be nice. Highly recommend.",4
"Updating my review (again) because of a genuine technical issue. Music keeps randomly stopping in the middle of playback now - no reason why. Only fix is closing and reopening the app, making the issue stupendously frustrating. * This app used to not only be competent, but actually good. Dunno what sort of shareholder-focused model y'all have seemed to move toward in recent years, but it's not really producing an app that people enjoy using. * Sort it out Spotify, come on.",1
Literally disappointed...Spotify was perfect before but now all you guys want us to do is pay money to listen to songs...I used to love this app but now I'm so done with it. Like you can't rewind or move to the next song you can't play songs in order and you can't even choose songs from the playlist! All you need is premium...Give us the free version back where we can do everything...This is just not acceptable...at this point all we can do is play and pause songs or podcasts. JUST DISSAPOINTING,1
It use to be the best but now it has became the worst. After recent update a lot of changes had been made which are not at all useful instead they have started irritating me. In all my playlist I can't see the name of the song instead it's showing name of the artists are you guys out of your mind how can I remember the name of artists and who are you to constantly add songs in my playlists and why to make the song bar in playlist so big. Due to this recent update you all will only loose users.,1
"Wow, even begging has its limits, and this app has crossed that. First, we had to listen to ads, then came we can't skip songs, then we can't even go forward or backward on the same song, then we couldn't play in a fixed order- we had to shuffle. And now, we can't even shuffle in our own playlists! It will be smart shuffle where the app will choose songs for us and play them whether we want it or not! It's no wonder your app has ratings even lower than 1.7!",1
"new update changes the like button to a plus which is the same as the add to playlist button, small but unnecessarily complicated update. After searching for a song, tapping the three dots menu does not include an option to add to liked songs like it used to. That means I have to stop listening to the song I'm currently playing to play the new song so I can like it. Why?? Suggestion; Allow download of lyrics along with the download of songs. Still love the app. Thanks!",2
This is so disappointing. I am dropping this app. This used to be one of my favorite app to listen songs to but today I get the notification that I only have 6 skips left per hour and I can not even skip or select another song from my playlist when a song is playing without using premium. And the frequency of the ads are just unbelievable. I am really really really disappointed with this.,1
"The user interface got worse compared to previous version. I would like music player to be easy to use and simple. Why is the home screen showing me tons of videos? Why is the spotify overlay on lock screen now 80% album image and 20% controls, making it hard to actually hit the button if you're not paying full attention to your screen? Please, just do one thing and do it well - playing music.",2
"Keeps randomly pausing and keeps having log in issues; ""something went wrong"" If I could give it one star again, I would. I'm not the only one having this issue of Spotify randomly pausing. It should automatically be configured to be able to play in the background. Obviously the root of the problem has not been pinpointed by their support, since they ask for reinstalls and things like that",1
"The new layout sucks. Can't find or get to any playlists that are made for me, you scroll down and it starts playing music from playlists that you don't want to listen to. They used to have it to where when you play a song, and that song ends, they play similar songs or artists.. now it just keeps playing the same song over and over. Spotify used to be great, even though they hardly pay anything to the artists for streams, but they've gone downhill. Time to use Apple music now.",2
"Spotify was genuinely one of the best music app but it's so disappointing how worse it has gotten. We can't skip the song , play what we want to after a particular period of time, see the lyrics , play a particular part. One can't listen to music properly anymore....I don't SUGGEST Spotify to anyone anymore. Ads were better than all of the changes they have made 😐...",1
"Man this app was good before the update, you don't need premium to enjoy your songs. The adds were there but wasn't a big problem for me as I was not using premium. The best part was that I could listen to the songs i like with the playlist i created. But after the update, all the features was taken away, can't playback, can't continuously listen to my own playlist, and the ads. One more thing was that before update, sometimes you get this 30 ad free listening feature, and now its also gone.",2
"Worst. What's the use of playlists now? It's basically a radio. I ain't signing up for a god damn radio. Thank you spotify for the wonderful experience. To make up for this, you gave us wrapped, aye? Don't even get me started on the seeking option. Could've been a zero star. YT Music better(it allows us to place songs in queue and has the option to skip a good proportion of their ads.",1
"Spotify has once been a symbol of good and reliable software in Android, but lately the app os full of bugs. Sometimes I'm listening to a podcast, pause and when I open the app to resume playing, it starts playing a random playlist. Sometimes the play button doesn't work on the episode I was listening and I have to hit play on another title and get back to the one I really wanted to listen. Just to listen a few. I don't know what you are doing, but it's time to focus on sanitizing your code",1
"Been using Spotify for a long time so I haven't moved out to a different software but at times I am very tempted to do so. I like the interface and what it offers but, the algorithm isn't what it used to be only gives me the same genre now as suggestions it used to give me a playlist with a good mix. What really drove me to write this review is that the audio goes out every 30 seconds then I have to hit pause then play again. I cleared the cache then works for a few.",2
"pros: pretty much any song or podcast you can think of is on here. it's decently user-friendly and the user interface is well-designed. cons: good GOD the ads are obnoxious. unless you have premium, you get hit with anywhere between 1-5+ ads after 2 songs, and random songs will start playing occasionally too because playlists don't loop back to the beginning. the player gets buggy and audio will stop playing for no reason randomly, and you have to reopen the app to fix it.",3
"This app has progressively gotten worse over the years. Every day it gives me one more reason to stop paying for it. It changes playlists after being paused for a while. The shuffle feature doesn't really randomize your playlist, but just feeds you the same handful of songs over and over. Sometimes it will play the same song after only a few others, despite the repeat function being off. The price keeps going up, and so do the number of ads. Paying for ads at all is ludicrous. They don't care.",2
"It's an amazing app with the premium Spotify, it has incredible features, though, it would be cool to see on what playlists a song is added in all Spotify, it should pretty easy to implement seeing how the development APIs work, just have access to that it would be cool. The free version of the app it ain't so bad on computer and console devices, on phone, you can't choose the song and ads are more frequent. If you love music and don't mind having randomized the songs, this is a wonderful app.",4
"I have had this app for 6 years and just switched to Apple Music. For one, it shuffles the same dozen songs in my playlist rather than shuffling through the hundreds that I actually have. Second, half the time, my ""downloaded"" songs do not work without data, which they should. I would definitely recommend Apple Music over Spotify; it is better in every way.",1
"For several months now, music keeps stopping all the time, even though the music is already downloaded, as I'm a premium subscriber. Power saving mode is off. I have to literally go to the app, wait for the dark blank screen to load the song again, and press play. That is dangerous while driving. A losss of internet connection in areas should not affect this since music is already downloaded and playing in offline mode. Please fix this. Thank you.",1
"Spotify is great for listening to music, that's assured. But recently I've encountered a small issue, my number of ""liked songs"" is off, like every so often it will show I have 1 or 2 more liked songs than are actually in there, which leads me to believe songs are being deleted, but the number stays? I'd hope that's not the case, as when it comes to niche artists with very obscure tracks, it becomes rather hard to find them again.",4
"Used to be my favorite music app. Now it's horrible. Limits on everything, number of songs, queue, no going back while adds are running, no backward or forward, and those super annoying adds. I've never written any review on anything but this app compelled me to write first ever review of my life. Thanks to Spotify. Now this app runs only and only for business and money. Immediately uninstalling.",1
"I love this app, I've been using it for years & have been subscribed to premium for years. it has virtually every song, however, the issues with song suggestions have become so unbearable. Playlists will play the same songs over and over again, playlists of 100+ songs!!! Spotify recommends the same songs over and over again, it never gives me anything new, and when i use the dj, it's constantly ""based on recent listening"", it's SOOOO repetitive and annoying. I hope there will be a fix.",4
"Worser now. Full ads, plays wrongs songs, doesn't play my playlist, can't even change song now! That's become premium. Shuffle play is horrible. Can't easily add to playlist. Can't play what song you wanna hear. Ads play offline. Wouldn't recommend. And too much storage space for no reason(3.3GB for 0 Downloads). Deleting. Good riddance to bad rubbish you could say. Plus no lyrics. Can't search for dong. Recommendations are wrong. Uses location data, without permission. Sus use of microphone.",1
"This used to be my favorite music app, but it's gotten so annoying and difficult to use, especially with the smart shuffle option. There should be an option to permanently turn off smart shuffle in the settings. I want to listen to my music, not what Spotify recommends, plus the smart shuffle is difficult to turn off. The app is just very laggy overall, and will still sometimes play the music even when I have it closed.",3
"I used to love this app but recent upgrades have made it less user-friendly. I agree with the other reviewers, the old way of adding songs to a playlist wad much easier and the heart for favorites was great for quickly adding to my favorites. (Now it's a tedious task.) I also have found even after turning off the feature where it adds new songs to your playlist based on what you're listening to, I still find random songs and playlists (Beast Mode?) being added. It's harder to navigate the app.",2
"I typically use Spotify on a daily, the only thing that's an issue for me is it doesn't show the lyrics for most songs on certain playlists and such (with the update), and sometimes my music will stop and I'll have to pause and unpause it just to get it to work. And sometimes I have to close out of the app completely in order to get it to play. I'm not sure if it's a bug with the app or if it's just my phone service, but other than that there's a need for bug fixes but it is a good app to use.",4
"I would give it 4 stars because overall, it's a very good app. However, without premium, you can't choose which songs you want to play. That's fine with me if the app wouldn't play the same ones every time! I'm always hearing the same songs and almost never hearing any different ones, and it's so irritating! Even with a small playlist, it always plays the same song over and over again, then even when it hasn't played the whole playlist, it plays a song that isn't even in the playlist!",3
"While I love listening to music in the car with this app, it often has problems. When playing on my phone, I can't even get thru a single song without the program crashing. Also I've had to disable the automatic playing of songs in android auto because the program stalls when starting up in the middle of a song; sometimes I have to disconnect my phone, shut down the program, then plug the phone back in. Sometimes songs wont play in the middle of a playlist unless I do the same thing.",2
"I like a lot about the app but there are a couple of things I don't... I find the shuffle options frustrating and even when it says smart shuffle off it still adds songs to my playlist. The biggest pet peeve is that after the first time I listened to podcasts while driving on Bluetooth/dashboard, I lost the video to my podcasts permanently no matter which settings I have tried. And yes they are video podcasts. If anyone can help I'd appreciate it.",3
"Pro's.... streaming music and no ads on premium, very good, £12.00 a month, suden intake a breathe! A bit steep if you ask me. Make your own playlists, and listen to only what you want to hear. Con's.... app is constantly crashing, stopping, and after seven or more attempts at closing the app and then restarting, it might start working again. Very frustrating, especially when they are charging so much. Tried cleaning the cache and reinstalling, still the same. Still in free trial so will see.",3
"Garbage app. Always crashes when I open it, so I can't play anything. Always have to wait for my music to load to play as if it is trying to stream it, even though it is saved to my phone. Currently having to re-download, again, as I can't play my music or podcasts. For the number one streaming app, everything should be seamless, but everything about it is just hard work!",1
"Music stops playing when the app is closed. I use the ""close all apps"" button on my phone to close apps and save battery. Other media apps like YouTube and Twitch do not terminate audio, so it's not a tech limitation, it's simply bad design. Additionally, when you set Spotify to ""Downloaded only"", it still tries connecting to internet to find your downloaded music. I can never listen to my downloaded music without internet, even though that's the whole point of downloading music for offline!!",2
"The app is good overall, a large variety of musics, podcasts and some other. The bad thing about it, unfortunately, is the fact that lyrics, that were free around july or june from last year (2023). Lyrics started to vanish, and then I found out that they were mostly at premium now, found out about it when I started my trial. If you want just to listen, go ahead and install, but if you want to see the lyrics to either sing or understand the music properly, you will have some issues with this.",4
"Spotify is a good app. That is only if you have premium. The audio quality is really good, the wide selection of songs is amazing. But without premium, you can't really do too much. I had a hard time trying to navigate to a single song I wanted to listen to, but instead I got random music that Spotify added. You really can't make playlists or listen to music, unless you have premium.",3
"I like the decisions you have taken in developing this app. Whether it's design, ux, features etc. it's been pretty great! But this past year (2023), using the app on an Android tablet (samsung s7 plus, or SM-T970) has been painful stability wise. On different phones, everything's pretty much perfect. But on a tablet, in about every third session, the playback stops w/o a reason. Restarts just crash the app on startup. Need to clear cache to recover. Please, focus on stability for a while.",3
"Down to 2.0 ratings!? Deserved it!! It used to be my favourite music streaming app, but with the latest update, it's nothing more than trash. Seeking, playing previous/next songs, these are the basic features of a music streaming application, the BASIC!! All this for premium!? I mean wht!? I've already uninstalled it, and pretty sure others have too. Hope it changes soon. Again, it was the worst decision, Spotify India!!",1
"The music is amazing, but the app itself is extremely invasive. Somehow when I start my car or really any BT device, spotify will turn on and overwrite whatever I'm doing. Weather that be watching youtube, talking on the phone, watching a movie. Even when the app is closed, It will magically reopen and play some random station. The app itself is probably the worse app of any music subscription I have.",1
"The worst ever update. Can't skip songs, can't play previous song, can't repeat the song, can't play whichever song we like on OUR PLAYLIST, can't play a particular part of the song, can't loop or skip the playlist. And whenever you try to do all these, it asks for premier membership. That's not the end, after each song 3 ads pop up. Like what the hell is the update all about? To get premier membership bruh? I didn't knew they would go to this extent for getting membership from the listeners.",1
"The latest update is glitchy as all get out, it plays a random playlist as soon as it connects to my car Bluetooth and keeps crashing while I'm driving. Also very frustrated with the change to showing downloaded releases separately when you click on an artist—I want to be able to shuffle my favorite artists' whole discography that I've liked, not just pick specific albums. And while I'm at it, smart shuffle is a huge pain; I never want it on, and there's no way to disable the button.",3
"All of a sudden the app is constantly glitching and my music either won't pull up and start no matter how many times I open and close the app, or my music pauses randomly in the middle of a drive and I can't fix it because I'm on the road. Car mode is awful and causes a glitch every single time. Maybe I'll start using the app again once they fix it.",1
Not optimised for Samsung/Exynos chips. Severe battery drain compared to Snapdragon counterparts. No song year info. No automatic sorting of genre or generation of playlists based entirely on lines songs. Audio quality is good. Music/Speaker share is good. Lyrics/Karaoke is good. There is a bug sometimes where the app just won't play audio despite the timer showing the song is playing. I am a subscriber. I do find the in-app text ad banners very annoying.,3
"Shuffle has been a feature in media devices and software since the 80's, Spotify thinks it's premium which tells me they don't have much to offer when they charge for basics. Playing 6 songs in a row off one album is not a cultivated playlist. I've tried this app every so often since it's release and it's nevwr introduced me to a new artist despite entering in music ranging from hundreds of years ago to last week. Everytime I try it, I think YouTube music does it better which is a low bar.",1
"this app is awful, it's treated nothing like spotify web or pc as you can't turn off shuffle, add songs to queue, loop playlists, and worst of all there's ads every single song you choose. the web/pc version is miles better as you can unshuffle your playlist, set the shuffle to go one time, loop songs, add songs to your queue, and there's occasional ads that don't appear every song you click. the only good use this app has is using it when you either don't have a pc or when you're away from home",2
"Not even a month & the true colors of forcing someone to adopt premium is seen. Two weeks back when I started using this app, I could turn shuffle on & off, seek the player on parts I loved, but I found now I can't do that. Plus playing suggested songs automatically after every song. I haven't seen apps that I have used restrict these little things. But you know what, there are ad free apps where we can find all the songs in Spotify and at least our convenience is taken care of without charge.",1
"The free version has beend downgraded to the point where we cant rewind,shuffle as we wish listen to a particular part on a song and alao there's ad between each song. And I don't know if this a new ""feature"" on the free version or if it's just a technical difficulty but I'm not able to veiw lyrics to songs anymore!?!? I'm honestly not at all satisfied with spotify's service, it's just an app full of ads to get users to buy premium and very minimal features that just suck at this point!!",1
"Spotify considers that people that create their lists to listen, don't know what they are doing and forces a shuffle, either from your list, either from something that doesn't interest me a bit... I disconnect it, it connects again... And mostly when I am driving which takes the purpose out. About to cancel my subscription after years of use, completely fed up. Contacted support and nothing can be done.",1
"I've loved this app for about a year (premium specifically). But recent updates have made the app almost annoying to use. For one, a feature that I adored has been removed. Is that being a pop-up if a song is already in your playlist and the ""skip songs already in playlist?"" option. That was probably my favorite thing about this streaming specifically. Making a playlist was fun and easy with that feature. If it changes back I'll definitely update this review,but until then it's becoming annoying",2
"I mean the app is positively great, mostly love it. The obvious issue is mostly the disgraceful compensation received by artists per stream, aside from that the app works great. It used to work wonderfully, but the latest addition of ""smart"" recommendations is absolutely asinine. All it does is 1) eliminate the usefulness of dowloading any playlist, 2) making switching between shuffle and nonshuffle delayed and 3) less functional and buggy. There needs to be a way to disable this altogether.",3
"I would give this 0 stars if I could. This app was great, until everything turned dark. As many other reviews put it, the free version is horrendously unusable. You can't loop songs, you can't play songs in order, you can't shuffle playlists, YOU CANT EVEN PLAY THE PREVIOUS SONG. If you're looking for a new music app, this is definitely not it. Spotify now sucks, and I'm not taking that back until they take these changes back.",1
I really liked the app for playing podcasts while running or hiking. For this reason I needed to download the selected podcasts to my phone. Now this important feature sometimes works but mostly not. The app really became useless. Plus. It was much easier to add or remove podcasts to a list in the past. The process became complicated recently and needs more steps to remove a podcast from a list. Why ruin something that worked well in the past?,1
"I've been using Spotify for more than 3 years but I think this is it. Spotify updates are getting worse and worse. It is becoming a place where only the premium users can enjoy music. You can't loop, queue, rewind, skip, play in order or shuffle songs without a premium account.Now is the time to leave the app and listen music somewhere else peacefully like SoundCloud ytmusic etc.",1
"I love this app, yes, but I find it so dumb that I have to listen to around 4-6 ads just because I listened to two songs. Not to mention on phones, you can't even replay the songs and you can only skip 6 songs per hour. Premium only allows you to replay the songs more than once and takes those stupid ads away, but what else? I could find another music app and they'd let me play offline, skip more than six times, and play less ads then this one. Be for real spotify.",2
"Rarely works correctly anymore. Started glitching out when playing, pausing and refusing to play again, forcing me to reset my phone just to make it work right. When connected to a PS4, it commonly says the scene is blocked and music can't be played, the scene isn't actually blocked and the app has to be manually opened to reset the ""feature"". When connected to car speakers it will refuse to play, making you hit the play button over and over again. This is just a short list of issues too.",1
"I'm really disappointed in the quality of product that the Spotify app is. I installed it on 3 different operating systems, and they all have problems with basic shuffle play!! Shuffle play won't turn on, or won't turn off, will play the same group of songs over and over (instead of the entire playlist). I (wildly) assume there is a lot of corruption in their company because I have been using Spotify for years and they never fixed shuffle play. It such a simple feature. Why not fix it?",1
"I'm a paid subscriber to Spotify, and I've been facing a persistent issue with the app. When I use it offline, my downloaded songs and podcasts do not appear at all. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but the problem remains unchanged. Even when I go online, for example, during flights, my downloaded content doesn't show up. Could you please provide assistance in resolving this issue?",1
"I would like to see you people at Spotify try and push these new ""features"" to people who just started using spotify. You wouldn't cause it would be easier to say ""You need to pay to use Spotify"". Daily limit on skips, no seek, no option to go back to previous song, no option to view the playlist. I had said in a previous survey from Spotify that i would rather have YouTube premium over Spotify cause not all songs are there in Spotify. Thanks for making it easier to make a decision now.",1
"App is now better off dead! If you have a smart speaker or PC at home with Spotify logged in, good luck listening in on the go. Mobile app will automatically switch to those devices without you interacting with it! You'll maybe get 30 seconds in before the switch, even if you switch back. And the new ""like song"" button, correction, the ""check song"" button. Makes literally no sense. Spotify keeps going more and more downhill and it is becoming less and less worth paying for the premium service...",1
Worst experience! I hate Spotify now! If there would be an option to give stars in negative I'll definitely give it minus stars. Basically they removed all features of a music app. Like you can't seek to a specific part of the song you just have to listen the whole song from starting to listen your favourite part. You can't disable the shuffle button in any playlist. These are the dumbest things they have done. I don't think I (who listens music less frequently) will going to buy a premium.,1
"Good till they blast you with ads! For some reason I wasn't getting many ads at all, now all of a sudden, it will only play ads!! I was trying to listen to a song and it honestly just played like five ads in a row. What the heck Spotify??? Ok I just realized I must have been doing the free trial for the premium. If you don't mind random music then this app is great, but when I want to listen to a certain song and it will only play random bad music I get upset. I'm uninstalling this.",1
"I used to LOVE this app. It updated recently and now I can't find how to get to my ""now playing"" list. It used to be a simple bar across the bottom and now it has disappeared. Part of the reason I love Spotify is because you have the ability to create playlists and move songs around within those playlists freely.. Bummer they're making it so much less accessible.",2
"The new update has made it so that you can't even replay a song without premium, or organize your queue, or skip to a specific part of the song. At this rate I'm confident, they'll update the app soon, so that you'll need premium to even play music. Edit : Now you can't even skip more than 6 songs per hour without premium. Becoming extremely useless for music streaming.",1
"They NEED it back to how it was before! Back when spotify actually was good, I was using it ALL THE TIME. But now i barely use it because it's so bad now. First off, I can't play the songs I want to play because spotify plays suggested songs, and all my playlists are RUINED and most of the time the lyrics are gone and it says we can't load them and it's so annoying! Don't even get me started on the number of ads there are, and they say every 30 minutes when it's after every song! Please fix this",2
"I cannot begin to explain how upset I am. This new update is so so so annoying. I can't loop songs, decide the order that I listen to it and to top it all off, I can't even replay a certain part of song. This has just ruined the spotify experience for me, it use to be my favorite, but I don't know, if you're thinking of downloading this app without premium, DONT.",1
"Been using this app for at least 3 years and I've never really had much of an issue with it until now. Since the most recent update, it randomly jumps around to different podcasts when one ends, even though I selected a specific podcast channel. It's also having way more freezes when I pause songs or podcasts. It just locks up and I have to close it out and also close it out from the background if I'm using Bluetooth ear buds, which is usually how I'm listening.",2
"Earlier the only problem was ads.. But now it's on a different level - you can't start from your desired point, no lyrics, and icing it with ads. If you want to hear music, you must hear ads for 3-4mins, then comes the music. All this for a Premium!!!! Frustation at its peak. I might get really frustrated someday and delete the app. Changing my review, 10 Dec 2023 : Thanks for giving back the primary features.. I hope this won't change.",4
"Feeling let down by Spotify these days. It used to be my go- to app for any music, but the recent changes that are made are very frustrated for general users (one without premium). We are missing the flexibility to choose songs of our choice from our playlist, or skip or repeat the song freely. On top of everything, the constant ads have become a real annoyance. Hoping for some positive changes soon",1
"I love this app!! However, ever since the latest update I've had issues with songs randomly stopping, even after I press play again, and the screen when you click on the current song glitches for a few seconds before going to the next screen. I'm not sure why it's doing that, but please fix it! If it hadn't been for all the glitches, I would have given 5 stars.",2
"Recently cancelled my plan because on the latest version of android, on my Pixel 4a (5g), the app does not work. The app will play music for a few minutes and then stop, but the player will act like it's still playing the song, just no sound will come out. I have reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, both fix it only temporarily, and it only happens with this particular app. So yeah. Not coming back until this is fixed.",2
"This used to be a 5 star app. As a premium subscriber for over a decade this app has been deteriorating in quality on both Android and desktop for over a year now. Lots of features are broken, you are randomly booted offline, playback stops, playlists and albums don't load, no animations, jittery screens, etc. Yes, I've cleaned my cache and yes I have the latest updates and the newest device. This is a problem with the app. If it doesn't improve in a month I will probably cancel my premium. 😔",2
"I've been a customer for years and I like the music availability as well as the algorithm for new song recommendations. The interface is simple and easy to navigate. I like how easy it is to make collaborative playlists. I am very displeased with the shuffle function as it always plays the same songs in the same order no matter what I do, and that is making my experience dull and disappointing. If shuffle were fixed, I'd rate 5 stars.",3
"I can't believe how bad this app is. It interferes with your satnav and you can't choose what songs to play. If you shuffle mode through a playlist it won't play all the songs in the playlist, it's not random, it follows the same pattern each time and will play the same song twice. If you use the free app you will get one, maybe two songs before an advert and it will just be the one advert. So if you have a playlist with 20 songs you will hear that ad 10 times. This app is vile.",1
"What the heck are you'll trying to do?It was fine to listen to ads when we didn't have premium. Not everyone can afford premium always. At first too many ads were introduced,then the shuffle option got turned on. After that we couldn't play a specific portion of the songs according to our likes,but now we can't even choose songs to play, we can't even skip too many songs to listen to our favourite ones.Is this your way of extracting money from us? Spotify was the best app but now it's the worst.",1
"As someone who has played spotify for a little bit for over 5 years now, I can say that it's the best free music streaming in the world. However, everytime u finished a song or two, it gives a two 30 second ads that I personally don't mind, it clearly still needs improvements. But, the fact that they started doing video advertisements on a music streaming app kind of makes me confused and mad. I'm giving this a 4 star because of this.",4
"Spotify was an excellent music platform before. But now it is nothing but a horrible app. You can no longer select the song you want to play. The queue system has been removed which is absolutely disgusting. The songs suddenly pauses and then I have to start the song again and I can't select the part where I wanted it to be. For the users sake, improve this disgusting problems. The problems are crossing the limits now. Hope next update will do something good ..",1
"Have used Spotify for years but recent updates make it a very frustrating app. Every now and then, music will just stop. Then I'd open the app and it would resume. Or the view of what song is currently being played would just disappear. Would be good if this can be looked into as to why the app performance has been impacted like this. Very annoying.",2
"Great app for listening to music, however, missing a lot of good songs/albums. Another issue (and for me, the bigger issue) I currently have is that I used to be able to choose if my music lowered or paused with incoming notifications. However, now they are lowered, and you can't change it. They say they are working on it, but it's been ongoing for a while, It's not good for an app many people pay for. Hopefully, this gets fixed very soon or my change music apps.",3
"I have no idea what has happened to this app recently, but I'm really getting tired of the constant autoplay. Every time I pause the podcast I'm listening to it happens. It's also always a podcast or music that I don't listen to and are definitely not on my playlist. Also, when I go to unpause the screen goes dark for absolutely no reason. Quit screwing up a good thing. Enough for the useless updates.",3
"This app is great for discovering new bands/artists and songs to listen to and enjoy, however I give such a low rating because I feel you are basically forced to go premium at this point because of so many ads with no 30 minute break. Otherwise this app is fantastic. The app has begun to skip songs or randomly start playing a song halfway through. This app used to be a lot better then its current condition.",1
"So I'm a free user, I've never bought premium services, so i was okay with ads, not being able to download songs. But after the recent update i can't even skip between songs, can't turn off shuffle, can't skip back, can't skip songs through lyrics. I'm so disappointed right now, even the audio quality sucks. Spotify used to be my favourite app for music but now i might not use it anymore. Can ya'll make Spotify just like it was before.",1
"The app was good till the latest update. Now I can't play the songs i want on repeat or in sequence. Random songs play due to the ""magic shuffle"" feature. This all seems to be a ploy to get people to buy the Premium subscription model. Well, no thank you. Amazon Music is way better now! Plus there's always YouTube. Your greed for money is going to lead to your downfall Spotify!",1
"I am using this app for 4 years but now it make frustrated. Like everything is premium now, you can't listen to one song again, you can't back, you can't off the suffle, you can't read the lyrics, you can't listen to that particular line again without listening the whole song again. I really don't like the new features. I like old spotify. I hating more and more day by day. Now playing song always stop in between without any reason.",1
"App used to be great (except for shuffle,which they have never fixed). I came to Spotify for the great selection of music. Now I'm looking for other apps. They keep adding features that don't work (SMART SHUFFLE), and removing ones that worked amazing! (ENHANCED PLAYLISTS). Music can be downloaded for offline listening on the preimium service, but every time I disconnect from internet, it ""forgets"" a bunch of my songs so can't listen to them and they have to be redownloaded. Customer support 👎",1
"I've been debating for a while whether to post a review. I used to love this app. Now I can't recommend it. Even with updates, the app works less and less well. Buttons now often work only after a slow reload. Features have been added that make it clunkier to use. I get recommendations that are not accurate to my tastes or genres. I get notifications that are about music, events, artists I'm not interested in. It's gone downhill since I wrote a glowing review in 2021. And it costs more! SMH",3
"Good new music, I'm using since 2019. But the last UI update is quite useless - if I like the song, it's easier for me just put the like (heart icon) and it will automatically go to the liked playlist. Also I'm creating other playlists to combine the music for different purposes. But now it's just plus icon, and if I'm looking to my created playlist, I didn't see which songs I liked. Quite uncomfortable. If you fix it back, will give 5 stars.",4
I used to loooove Spotify. But now I can't stand Smart Shuffle. I wish they'd go back to enhance mode. It's beyond irritating that I have to triple tap to just shuffle my normal playlist. I also miss where shuffle actually shuffled my songs. I used to be able to unclick shuffle and reclick it and the next song would be different. Now it doesn't do that. It's the same. I either have to skip the song (which in turn they'll use that data to never play it again) or close out the app and reopen it.,3
"Spotify is a wannabe social media app now. The user interface, especially in regards to podcasts, severely hinders navigation and finding what I need. It is not useful at all to scroll down music or podcasts ""pages"" one by one. Especially when much of it is unsolicited recommendations. The sound and video previews are also distracting. I wish I had kept my version of this app from about a year ago and never updated it.",1
"As much as I love the app, it's starting to get on my nerves. Every time I'm trying to listen to a playlist and a song is on maybe like half way or near the beginning the song just cuts off and I have no idea why. Like I've signed out then back in to see if that was the problem but it wasn't that, I checked if It needed to update but it didn't show anything and I don't know why it happens, the rare chance I'll be able to listen to a full song is RARE, FREAKING RARE!",2
So... for those who don't have Spotify premium... it really sucks. You will get ads every 2-3 songs. It is an ad streaming service. However!! With premium it is the best music streaming app. It has personalized Playlist and the recommendations are almost always on point. It is easy to use and the quality is great. Invest in premium it is worth it.,4
"I've seen other people's reviews and it seems like yhey're having the same issue as me. Lets say I want to create a playlist... I can create one but adding songs to it is a nightmare. Now, apart from that, let's say I already have a pre-filled playlist with all my wanted songs there. When I press the totally 100% working 'Play ▶️' button, it plays A RANDOM SONG THAT ISN'T IN THE PLAYLIST... Devs need to fix this mobile app issue - it's just too mad annoying.",2
"Speed wise, not as efficient as before. Even with my premium whatever I have playing is constantly pausing by itself, and when I go to press play again, it starts whatever I was listening to over again. The app has also been kicking me out randomly, and when I close/open it back up I have to do it multiple times before it starts up again. I have tried restarting my phone, deleting/uploading app again, on wifi and only mobile data. The results stay the same, unfortunately.",2
"Not happy with recent changes in Spotify's free tier.I've been a loyal user for years, and while I understand the need for ads,the current limitations are frustrating. I used to listen to songs 6-7hrs a day on Spotify,but now I feel like not to open the app because of these restrictions. I miss the ability to drag seek bar,play in the order I want,to the point where I'm considering migrating to another platform. I would appreciate it if you could consider bringing back the features to free plan.",1
"Honestly, the prices are too high, so that's why some people (and also me) want to change this streaming service for something cheaper and I understand why. Anyway, I think that there are some problems with Spotify. First of all, please, upgrade your visuals: album covers animations and photo quality, because every aspect of this is just bad sometimes. Secondly, add the ability to change the order of tracks in the ""liked songs"" as in a regular playlist. And bring the hearts back ;(",3
Trash. Free apps work waaay better than this. Video never works on Bluetooth. Constantly choosing other things to play than the thing that's already queued up. Sometimes it will change what you're listening to suddenly during actual playback of something else. Then there's the web environment. Constantly choosing other playback devices instead of the one you started it on. I don't have enough room to list out all the bugs. Honestly should have never made it out of Beta.,1
The app itself is fine. It's just that in the podcast section it keeps throwing these weird asmr audios in there. It won't allow me to delete them and I hate how it looks!! All I can do is click not interested and hope they go away. But it's been more persistent lately and looks really suspicious. Please make an option to be able to get rid of these easier. I don't even listen to podcasts!!🥲🥲,3
"The update is very bad we cant listen to the songs we want to listen and keeps on giving recommendations which i personally don't like as i want to listen to only the songs i have liked and u also cant change the song(min 6 changes per hour ) like what the heck ??? First, it was the most used app on my phone. Now, i rarely use it because of these updates. I didn't update for months, but to see the wrap, i updated it, and now i regret it 😭",1
Won't load spotify when I open the app. Blank screen . Tells me to add songs to playlist that show up blank but ive added songs.Keeping having to restart my phone to get it to work. Updated app yesterday. Bugger all improvement. 3 or 4 days of this. No reply from your twitter . Also can't use the shuffle on a playlist because there isn't an option to turn you shoving your song choice. I'm not paying to listen to your suggestions. Real shame,1
"The app is completely ruined for free users now. I used to love this app when I first made my account, because I could listen to music without many limits. Now, when I opened the app again today I couldn't even play anything from my playlist! It just plays audio samples, and random stuff added by AI. I'm not paying money just to listen to music for 30 minutes. Amazing attempt at trashing an app.",1
"The app told me to rate it, so I rated it 4 stars. It's a good app! It has a lot of good music and podcasts, but if you don't have Spotify Premium the ads are annoying. I'm pretty sure they only use the most annoying ads on their app to pressure you into buying premium. If you can get past the ads, though, the app is pretty solid for being free (granted that you don't buy premium).",4
"I've been using Spotify for over a decade, been paying for premium the majority of the time as well. Over the past year, the ability to listen to downloaded music ""offline"" has failed. It's the main reason I pay for premium; I live in a rural area with spotty cell service coverage & therefore would rely on my downloaded music to listen to on long drives. It's upsetting that this paid-for feature isn't working the way it should be. AND you raised the price for premium when it doesn't fully work.",2
"The new features that keep getting added are annoying. I don't want to automatically turn smart shuffle on, I just want to shuffle my Playlist. Want to like a song? Now you have to manually add it to liked songs , instead of just hitting a heart. Want to add duplicate songs to a Playlist? Too bad, you can't anymore, unless it exists on another album or as a single. Quit ""fixing"" what wasn't broken in the first place.",1
"I've had spotify for close to 15 years. And its progressively gotten worse. Constantly crashes. Constantly stops playing and resets to the belief what was playing. Fails to load. Has to be restarted several times to even get something to play. I've been a loyal customer for years. But I'm about to wash my hands of it, just because of how buggy the app has gotten.",1
"What the actual heck!! The new update just ruined the app for me, I mean come on why the heck would you make basic music functions for premium you can't shift the song, can't go to the previous song, can't stay in the same playlist, can't shuffle the playlist, and have ads at the worst times. Just how far does this app has to fall before they decide to fix the damn thing!!",1
"Absolutely atrocious, I've paid for a second person on my account, every time I try to add them there is an error. It's been 2 days, we are on a ski trip, and we can't both listen to music. This is after a year of headaches with Spotify. They are too busy finding ways to make sure people don't share accounts to worry about the service they provide. Thanks for the response Spotify. I did try to find a way to contact you before my review, but even your directions show how it's not straightforward",1
"Great app. I'm rating it 4 stars because the ""hide song"" feature seems like it's not working. I am assuming that it I'm using someone's Playlist and I ""hide"" a song it would not play that song, but these songs are still playing. For now it's frustrating and maybe I don't understand the intention of that feature. I would like something like that in the app though, where I can kind of edit the Playlist that I've found, at least by skipping certain songs. Thanks!",4
"The free version should be a lot better than it actually is. I don't mind listening to ads, but the notion of creating a playlist only for Spotify to add a load of random songs to it really irritates me and defeats the whole object of creating a playlist. The search feature is next to useless, you find a song attempt to play it and it plays a totally different song lol. Is it any wonder the pirate/torrent industry is so popular!?",1
"Spotify has become horrible now. You cannot listen to songs the way you want, cannot repeat them, can't even shift forward or backwards. We don't like this feature. Other music apps are better, at least without premium subscription you can still ENJOY music. Poor business spotify. We never expected this from you. Spoiled it badly. What's the use of this app now.",1
"Spotify connect message is too intrusive. It should have the same behavior as iOS where it pops up only once during app session. On Android it pops up constantly, launch the app, get a message, pause a song and re-enter the app, another message. It is far too frequent and really unnecessary, I know I have other devices I can connect to. I don't need to be told dozens of times throughout the day, it's and awful UI aspect of this otherwise great app.",2
"The new premium plan changes make the free user very confused. I can't play specific songs, I can't play playlists, i can't play 'in an specific order' it's very confusing. I can't pay for premium. I was happy listening to adds, and there were many of them. These new changes are pushing me to delete the app, because I can't figure what I can or can't do anymore.",1
"Latest app (Jan 2024) is a huge downgrade in experience. They removed the Heart button to mark a song as a favorite. It is only be a playlist called Liked Songs now. You can add a song to that playlist, but it's more clicks if it's in another album/playlist in your Library (not ideal if driving), and more importantly, I can't have/see favorite songs within a playlist, or otherwise see songs that I've marked as a favorite on my various playlists. So the whole concept of ""favorite songs"" is gone.",2
"Updating my review, but not adding any stars...seems everytime I use this app these days, there's ANOTHER dodgey bug or technical issue. I listen over several devices - ear buds, phone speaker, laptop and in car. There is ALWAYS a syncing issue. When I close and reopen, I get random playback of pods or music that aren't even on my playlists. Sometimes it won't play at all without closing and restarting. Reinstall doesn't change anything. Not to mention, sound quality seems to have plummeted.",1
"love it but recently it randomly goes silent after a while. The song keeps playing but without sound. I have to pause, or interact with it in any way and it's fixed but I don't want to pause a song every 30 seconds when I'm listening to mysic. At first I thought it's my headphones fault but it keeps happening without them too. I have cleared my cache, reinstalled the app and checked the permissions, nothing helps. pls fix",3
"I have used Spotify for all of my music needs for over a decade, also paid for the premium service for almost just as long. Over all it has been a great way to listen to what I want with usually minimal hastle. For the past two year i have been using it for podcasts as well, with that I get graced with adds that I have to skip. Then to add insult to injurie they recently made it impossible to skip these adds. I PAY FOR THIS SERVISE AND I'M BEING FORCED TO LISTEN TO ADDS, corporate greed!",1
"I like Spotify, but I miss 2 features that have been abandoned and were very important for me. 1. Spotify run was amazing. The alternate app made by a developer is terrible in comparison. 2. I really miss when Spotify stayed in sync between multiple devices. This is completely gone and I find it so annoying. I used to be able to listen to a Playlist in my car, go to my pc and it would resume from where I was in my car. This was on all Google pucks as well. Now, each device has it's own memory.",3
I love Spotify but the app is laggy. Pressing a button in the app might have the app take multiple seconds (>5 or 10) to carry out the command or pressing a button does nothing. It also takes a long time for stuff to load in the app (such as a playlist even if it's downloaded). I'm considering not renewing premium. UPDATE: Second time uninstalling and reinstalling. It is getting worse in some ways. Not even downloading for minutes until it finally decides to start.,2
I want to listen to podcasts while driving. The experience isn't good. I have very little control. It seems like I have to take it out of car mode to select episodes only for it to revert to car mode where I have no control. It seems to default to a mode where its constantly suggesting casts I have no interest in without showing me the ones I want to choose from. Probably needs a dedicated pod cast app version,2
"This has become the biggest waste of storage space on any device. It used to be good, however, after recent useless updates, lyrics aren't visible for half of the songs, can't rewind, can't skip songs, can't queue, can't forward, we get 3 ads in a row, can't select song, we can basically do nothing. Considering how good spotify used to be, this is a huge downgrade. No logical person would waste money on premium. Better shift to YouTube music. Spotify has become useless. What goes next, pausing?",1
"I've used spotify premium for years, never had many issues until recently. It seems to get stuck a lot at the moment. I'll try to play a podcast episode, which then won't load and then I can't seem to listen to any others either. It also gets stuck on those episodes in the drop down menu of my phone screen. No matter what is playing, the stuck podcast episode is shown. Only thing that seems to fix it is uninstalling and re installing the app, which I've had to do multiple times recently.",3
"Stops randomly on almost every song. I am a paid subscriber. This is unacceptable. Tried uninstall & then reinstalled. It did nothing to help the problem. Unless the app is kept on screen, otherwise it plays in the background for a while before stopping. The app is still active,but music just stops & I have to manually press start again. Samsung Z Fold 5. This issue started a couple of months ago. ""Hey Spotify AB."" It'd be best if there was a faster way to prompt a message to reach ""contact us""",1
"Premium customer. Good, but: 1. Get rid of the neverending, annoying, screen-blocking scroll of the last thing played (which also sticks relentlessly in phone's push notifications). When I close out, just go away. Don't be annoying! No one wants constant scrolling! Why not use Netflix model and have a ""keep listening"" option on the home screen, instead? Also, FIX your Roku app so we can turn off the TV screen! Thanks.",4
"Missing obvious features. You can't normalize the sound output, so that all songs are equal volume, or to limit loud sections blasting your ears after you turn it up for quiet sections. You also have to manually mark songs and playlists for offline listening; It should be pretty straightforward to auto-download playlists I've saved to my library, and remove the least recently listened ones when running out of room.",3
"It's not really just a ""problem"" anymore now. It's a massive one. Lately for me and my family Spotify has been bugging the hell out then after, all of our downloaded playlists are gone. I'm a creator for playlists and it annoys me so much when I got to re-download them all over and over again Do get this fixed soon so it can stop, it would be deeply appreciated.",2
"Spotify has reached peak frustrating. Smart shuffle; horrible and constantly turning itself on??? The new like/add to playlist button; horrible (people generally listen to music while doing things, running, driving, we don't want to fumble around to add/remove a song), and since that feature I've noticed songs have accidentally been removed from my playlists! More and more of the bands I like are disappearing from the app too, it's time to find an alternative...",1
Earlier when I downloaded spotify app it was spectacular although the ads were there but we were able to choose the songs that we want to hear and could play it a million times continuously but not now. I can't play my songs after I have heard 5-6 of my choice then it shows to upgrade to premium or you can't play your own songs. The app plays the songs randomly after that and has restricted our aceess to it. Spotify do something about this!,2
"its a good app and it does what i want it to -play music- and it lets you pick the first song you want to listen to and then it just stays on shuffle (i don't have premium) which i don't mind. the only problems i have is that sometimes it says i am gonna get 30 mins adfree music but i get an ad after only one song, which it didn't do before. it also doesnt have lyrics on some songs that used to.",4
"What happened to the spotify app? Getting very buggy. A lot of the time podcasts are not starting where I was up to. Or starts a different podcast show all together. Or starts a completely random song (I checked, nothing in the queue) Also when I press the back button to go back to new episodes, it always starts from the top of the list, so I have scroll down again every single time. Can you please fix? Spotify used to be solid as rock but it's slowly getting worse.",3
"Spotify was my go to app for listening to songs, I didn't mind waiting through the ads for a minute or two often, but recently the removal of QUEUE feature has been a major letdown. I can no longer arrange the songs according to my mood- which is indeed a MAJOR letdown since that's what we listen to songs for. I really hope the developer and the team bring back the feature. It's no surprise how quickly Spotify is losing its popularity and ratings. A major disappointment from my comfort app",2
Yes Spotify is very good but the ads are absolutely insane it's like two songs and four ads. It's like they're purposely dumbing down access and your playlist to make you buy the premium subscription. And it seems like when you're listening on your phone or a tablet or something you only have access to a partial list of your total songs. Even on shuffle you tend to hear the same songs over and over. But for free it's not bad.,3
"Pros: Huge library. Cons: New features are overly intrusive. No high definition audio. Getting expensive. Everything else is car (Android Auto) related... Difficult to navigate relative to the app. Subscribed podcasts never show in home, only library, and you cannot go to your library without opening the full app (in car mode). Auto plays when connected to a device (there used to be a way to turn this off?). When it does autoplay it's often not what you were last listening too.",2
"It's good except for two things- the 30 minute and free time after viewing a particular and isn't always 30 minutes and the app stops working sometimes when I have set a sleep timer on any podcast. Edit- now they don't even let you select the songs you want to play, it plays on shuffle, you can't access the lyrics or move on to a particular part of the song until you buy premium.",1
"I love the way you can just listen to music whenever and it's such a high quality but it's constantly closing out or stopping for no reason. I keep going back into it and it keeps doing it. It's really annoying, plus you have to pay 10-15 dollars a MONTH for it and if you don't pay you can't have wrapped and you get interrupted every one or two songs with 30 minutes of ads. It's seriously irritating. Spotify should just make it so we can listen for an hour without interruptions.",3
"Just finished moving all my playlists to a different music app. I'm not even complaining about the new update, in fact I'm fine with charging users for basic features. But it's just that Spotify is just so bad at UX, the desktop app is broken, music quality is the worst out of all platforms(on Very High), and I can't imagine why they would not let me copy paste song names? No matter how greedy a business is, the least it can do is allow for users to smoothly move to a different platform! Suffer!",1
"Multiple times for each song or podcast when I am listening to songs with my Bluetooth headphones, it will just stop randomly. It occurs on wifi and data. It occurs in downloaded songs and not downloaded songs. The pause button it still there when it happens, so it looks like it’s playing, but the audio stays stuck. It is occurring once every 30 seconds. I've noticed it only occurs with Bluetooth 5.1 devices but not with devices using older versions of Bluetooth.",1
"Spotify team: please stop removing useful features and replacing them with less useful ones. Liking a song used to be one click, now it's 3 clicks and a menu. Radio used to actually be radio. Now it's just a playlist called radio, which repeats constantly and can't be adjusted. Radio from playlist feature is gone. Just give us a legacy mode toggle if you're going to change so many things for no apparent reason.",2
"I have been using spotify for 1 year, and it's been great. But in November they changed there 'free' policy. First, we have to pay premium to remove ads, which is ok. Second, we cant skip to any part of the songs, so we have to pay, which is also ok. But third, we cant even control which song we want to listen to, at ANY time. Spotify if you are reading this, pls change your policy, otherwise its worthless😡",1
"What is going on with your app. Why is Spotify acting like it's a stranger to me all of a sudden. It always says offline when my data is obviously on, then I can't find my favorite songs, what's with the plus instead of the hearts? Please bring back the old version if you changed anything. The little things are not supposed to be touched. Dissatisfied, can't play songs when I want. What's the use of subscribing to it, wasting my money. Spotify should be about reliability. Thanks.",3
"It's has just become useless. The older version of it before the newer updates was much better. U can't listen to music according to your wish, can't repeat the song, can't skip the song, u just get only 6 skips per hour. All is that now if you don't take premium u can't listen to music as per your mood and taste. It has just become a wastage of time and space.",1
"I've been paying for the premium plan for years & over the past year or more now, the app just continually stops, stops playing & closes itself in the middle of a song or podcast. Sometimes is worse than others, where it will close every 40 ish seconds, 10+ times in a row! I thought maybe something was wrong w/ the app that downloaded, but I just got a new phone, hence new app & it's just as bad. Ive gone thru all the settings. HELP! Or I'm canceling my plan, can't pay for a service this bad!",1
"It was one of the best app and it used to be my fave but the recent update has changed everything upside down... you can't listen to specific parts of the songs, you cant play a song in loop, shuffle mode is always on even if you don't want it,adds are terrible it feels you're listening to songs between adds you can't change songs for more than 5-6 times a day and many more.. basically you cannot do anything if you don't have premium and i DONT SUGGEST it to anyone",1
"Driving mode is dangerous! No matter what you click, the app randomly does one of the following: Play a random episode from a podcast (starting at a random time), pause, or skip to the next episode. No button does what its supposed to. Its impossible to select episodes or even pause (the pause button also does one of the random actions listed previously). Outside of driving mode the app functions normally. UPDATE: Tried to contact Spotify support as requested, only AI support is available.",1
"Almost everything about the app is great or meets expectations. I greatly dislike the change from the heart symbol to the plus symbol for ""Liked songs"". The other made so much more sense and now it's easy to confuse ""liking"" and ""add to playlist"" cause they're both plus symbols 😒. An improvement I'd like to see in the future is better control over organizing the library.",3
"You guys are normally awesome so I feel slightly guilty leaving a 1 star review but I wanted your attention!! The new layout for podcasts SUCKS. Change it back plz. It used to make sense. Now it's like drive thru menus. All pictures, less info. Very frustrating. Some of us listen to more than 3 podcasts a week. We aren't children, we don't need bigger and more colorful pictures. This is an AUDIO platform! I much prefer ease of access to the sea of information!!",1
The last update is horrible. I just couldn't understand the reason behind removing the heart like button. It was aesthetically pleasing & working just fine. Now it just looks bland. Similarly changing playlist likes to saves? It's people save my playlist where it was people LIKES my playlist before. There is just no feel to it & don't fix something that's not broke for the sake of it. 2 stars.,2
"The new update is the definition of corporate greed. I get introducing brand new features that are paid-only, but to make 99% of the features *already available* paid-only? 🤡 Wow, atp the app is not free at all. Can't even select tracks on my own playlist, can't skip, can't select shuffle modes. And the ads! It's basically an app for listening to ads now with a couple of minutes of music in between once in a while. What a joke!",1
"I'm going to use a different Music App. Spotify charges a subscription fee for everything.I'm not referring to downloading the song.But, for example, if I want to play my favorite music, regardless of the song I choose, it says buy subscription, as if what the hell. Second, I'm unable to rewind the song. I was okay with the Advertisement. But now it's feels like it's not music it's money making app for the developer Subscription for small things. Disney hotstar doesn't even charge that much.",1
"This app is just great! Just wonderful. Some recommendations; 1. The editor's pick never has the genre I listen to. Everything in the app seems right until the editor decides to pick options from another universe, lol. I think you should look into that. 2. I also think you should further train your AI so as to filter through before suggesting a song list. Sometimes, the song list get so ""mixed"" with different kind of songs, I have to spend some time removing them. Thanks",5
"Main problem it has too many ads. I don't mind having to hear ads. But an ad after every single song? C'mon Spotify. And not only that but random songs I've never even heard of suddenly gets played in my playlist. Like ???? Why. ""Well you should get premium!"" I don't want premium. For the most part I don't exactly want to have to pay to listen to the songs I like. Yes, Spotify has a better experience with premium. I just don't want to get premium.",2
"i really love this app, and has been using it for years now. Although i do have a problem with the lyrics, they won't appear. It keep saying ""couldn't load lyrics for this song"" THIS SUCKS. I know it's musixmatch faults but you SHOULD'VE CONTACTED THEM. and Many people are having these kinds of issues. Hope u guys fix it, i'll change my ratings 'till then.",2
"The app has gotten so much worse like you can't even use the queue feature. You can't skip songs without getting an ad and you can't even fast forward them. It's honestly so bad, I can't find a new app that has the same quality as the old Spotify and it's so frustrating. I use mods but not even they aren't working nowadays. I can't login into Spotify even if I change my passwords. This is so annoying. Even their reviews have dropped to 1.7. I request spotify's team to bring the old Spotify back",1
It's been an great aap all these years but this new update is worst. If I have to do anything it shows that I have to buy premium. Like what the hell. Worst feature ever. Please bring back the old version It's far better I can't even play music in order. What I not in the mood of listening the other songs. At least let us listen our music in order that's the reason we make playlist. It's very very disappointing 😞 I think now. I have to us wynk music.,1
"Basically unusable without premium. When you lose your premium, your downloaded songs disappear? You should be able to go offline and keep your previously downloaded songs. The ads though, they're extremely annoying. I get that music isn't free and they need to make money, but I'd prefer random ads on the app such as banners or something instead of having music interrupted. Spotify is extremely greedy, I've been using it for years but changes should still come.",2
"I am really disappointed. This app used to be so good and one of my favorite but no more. I can't even get the bare minimum. The new features are so bad. It has now became the worst app. Without a premium I can do basically nothing, I can't listen to my playlist, I can't skip the song to a particular part, can't repeat nothing. On top of that the number of adds are ridiculous. It feels like I am listening song between adds which should have been the opposite. Do better 🙄🙄",1
"Overall very good app. I have very little experience with the free plan, as I use premium. I love the new AI DJ feature, and I would reccomend that in the future you should be able to tell it what you want to listen to, and it reccomend songs based on that, but it's very good. The only issue I have is that if a pause my music and don't return to it for a while, when I do come back to it, the current song that I was listening to doesn't play until I skip and then go back. Thanks spotify ❤️💯",4
"Horrible experience with this app lately. A few months ago, I wouldn't have even thought about giving it a one star, but here we are. Let's go through some of the reasons: 1) All these guys want is for their customers to buy premium 2) I was fine with the ads and not being able to download songs, but they have made some changes which I HATE. 2.a) No rewind 2.b) No choosing songs from the playlist 2.c) Songs playing from OUTSIDE THE PLAYLIST I ran out of characters, but overall, this is trash",1
"Your user interface is too smart for its own good. Being able to switch devices is really nice, but hiding them behind a picture of a speaker isn't the brightest move. The interactions with digital assistants leave a lot to be desired. Even when it's obvious we don't want Spotify involved, it switches devices, and songs -- sometimes at the same time.",4
"Have had minimal issues with this app in the past other than occasional network connectivity issues. However, recently the app has begun to force autoplay music every time I open the app, even if it is already running. I have been unable to find a way to turn this off which has been incredibly frustrating. This issue also often pairs with network connectivity issues with the app often 'forgetting' what I was listening 10 seconds ago and instead playing a random song from my listening history. 👎",2
"Ridiculous! Now, I can't even play a specific part of a song. Additionally, after sometimes, i can't even play song on my own choice. Moreover, they only let me skip 6 songs per hour. Because of their greedy mindset, they have made this app totally useless of free users. I was fine with the ads but now they have crossed the line. Here this Spotify, we have a lot of options available on playstore as our devices don't run on IOS so, all these changes won't force us to buy premium.",1
"The ONLY reason that I feel 3 stars is where you sit is because I have a passion for music that can not be overshadowed by anything else. What I find irritating is that after 2048 songs on my liked songs list. I started to lose artists. Songs will vanish and not show up when searched for, and for the first month of that happening, I actually thought they had been removed. I'd love feedback and a fix on this, as I love your app more than any other. (Ps. Thank you all for the music!)",3
"was five stars, but had to bring it down after this new update. replacing the like button with an ""add to"" button was probably the worst idea the team has had yet. it's horrible. I can no longer just quickly like a song, I have to scroll so far to even find my liked playlist when trying to add a song, if I'm listening while doing other things and press the ""add"" button, it adds the songs to my most recently updated playlist, and, worst of all, the green heart is gone.",3
"This app has gotten so much worse, ruined the heart button. When looping a song, it'll loop it a couple of times and then stop. This is mainly an issue for the Xbox, just fix the app already. Because even trying to loop songs from my phone doesn't work. Also I can't fully search a song from my likes, if I do and press the song, it doesn't play. But if I type a few words, find the song I want and click it it will work.",2
"Was a decent app for listing to music. On any given day I'd probably have said it was a 4 star app. Recently though, the app has completely lost it's mind. When you stop the app it'll sometimes pause for a couple seconds and then start a new song. Or it'll finish one song on your playlist and then jump to a completely different playlist. Several times now I've had it finish a song only to start the next song 20 seconds from the end. If it doesn't get sorted out soon I'll be switching apps soon.",2
"It was my all time music app.. Being a musicophile, I used it most of the time in a day but it says na, when something gets popular or loved by everyone, the quality of it gets degraded and that's what exactly happened to Spotify. It's disheartening that my favorite app has turned out to be a total paid version now and each of us can't afford that. Updated version is like you cannot repeat or can't even take back to any specific part. Spotify gonna loose many dedicated listeners like us.",1
"Currently has a major bug that makes playing it in the background impossible. I've installed and reinstalled, I've cleared cache, I've restarted my device twice, I've been to the community forum. This seems like a major bug users on many different devices are having, the app just crashes constantly. I just have to hope the team knows about this issue and is working on it but I can't find anyone Spotify talking about it anywhere. It's happening to paying and free version users. Really need a fix!",2
"Spotify WAS such a great music app. It was the best. But now, it's just gotten worse. One cannot listen specific parts of songs, one cannot repeat a song, cannot add songs to queue, that smart shuffle thing one can't listen a particular playlist/album it will add other songs, and most of the songs don't show lyrics.Everything is premium😑. Hope this new update changes.",1
"I use most of the time listening songs only in spotify, and I know that recent updates has brought some changes but y'all need to allow users to play a song from their playlist itself instead of switching to different artist as from different taste and genre. Our playlist are created base on different situations and emotions, I don't to listen sad songs when I'm feeling low or some rock song when I want to listen RnB. That's so stupid, the trick to get more premium users.",1
"I like it and I am paying for it and it is OK for PC. But I am mostly trying to use it on my phone and it is really getting on my nerves! It keeps stopping or restarting what I am listening to! Very, VERY frustrating! While I am writing this, it stopped again. Tried on different phones with different earphones and the problem persists, so it is obviously caused by the app. Terrible experience!",1
"Spotify is progressively getting worse. Firstly, there were too many ads but that's still okay. But now, a user can literally do nothing for free like you can't even listen to a specific part of a song or even rewind. You also can't skip more than 6 times in an hour. There are no lyrics for almost all the songs as it is which has been a persistent problem for quite a while. And last but not the least, many and I mean way too many songs were removed earlier on for whatever reason(s).",1
"🙂 Fine but not impressed. Because sometimes when wanted to listen to a single song, I cannot listen to to the song because it plays the whole album instead of the single track I wanted, this is a bit annoying for me personally. But I should mention that it is better than most of the audio streaming applications that I have used so far...I do recommend this for anyone who wants to listen to music. The PC version of Spotify is even better...",3
"I've used Spotify for several years and have been premium for at least 3... I have generally liked the service and considered it favorably. However, over the past few updates it's noticably declined in app quality. Most notably for me, it no longer skips hidden songs in playlists/albums. This can be pretty dang frustrating when I'm driving or otherwise have my hands full and can't skip past songs im not in the mood for or dislike. The ❤️ button being replaced with ➕ is also a really bad change.",2
"This app was ALRIGHT until the recent updates. It is much harder to add songs that I like. Give us the control back! Also my Spotify has been pausing and when I try resuming my music it goes back to the beginning of the song. I've tried updating, deleting and re-downloading the app, and changing my settings but nothing has worked. It's getting harder with this app I just want to listen to my music 🥲.",2
"This used to be 5 stars, but with some of the changes they've made I can't recommend it like I used to. 1) They took away the like button, so now to add a song to your Liked Songs like it takes three clicks instead of one. Why make it more difficult for people to add music? 2) For the last month or so music will constantly just stop. Not from closing the app, or pausing, or updates. Just. Stop. Whats the point of downloading music if you can't still listen to it? Consider a different app.",2
"Preferred download location will change from SD Card to internal with updates, so I disabled auto-update. The new tap to jam function only works for a short while with iphones, then seems to get stuck and any action I make wont be sent to the ""master"" iPhone/jam leader. Spotify never seems to ever make one single solid feature...always buggy. If you're not already in Spotify, I suggest try looking at other streamig services, if they have the music you like.",1
"I love Spotify usually. But if the song pauses for a video on another app, my now playing gets reset. Also, Spotify keeps pausing while I'm driving and connected to Bluetooth, making me have to unpause it while driving, sometimes up to 15 times in the space of a couple of minutes. Edit: It's been happening a while now. I factory reset my phone and reinstalled, and it still does it. I have two user profiles ony phone, personal and work. I use Spotify mostly in work (hgv driver)",3
"I've been using this app for almost two years now. I thought it was fine until the latest updates; ""Limited skips"" ""Limited turns to pick songs to play"" It's horrible. I've gotten irritated at these. And oh my goodness, do not start me with the ads. Even though it said: ""Enjoy 30 minutes of ad-free listening starting now."" I think it meant 30 seconds. Everything about Spotify sucks. Delete the latest updates or revamp them. I hate the fact you make people use Premium for almost everything.",2
"I'm trying to listen to a playlist, and it keeps turning shuffle on. No matter how many times you turn it off, it always turns itself back on. It also starts playing songs that aren't even on there halfway through the playlist. When listening to podcast episodes, it keeps going back to the beginning, and you lose your place. It's incredibly frustrating when you are halfway through a book, and it goes back to the start. Each update seems to make the app worse.",1
"Used this for years, have reviewed on other accounts. The pushing of the smart shuffle is one of the most annoying things. Borderline unplayable when driving because no matter what queue I set up, or what song list, smart shuffle will overwrite it and begin playing random songs that I'm not interested in. I dont even have a choice in the music, it just does what it wants whenever I change it.",1
This use to be a great app. It completely sucks now and they went up on their price over a dollar. Which isn't a problem except the music stops every five minutes. I use this for my job. I have updated phone and the app. I have Uninstalled and reinstalled all blue tooth connections. It's not the internet service. Very disappointing. It never did this before. I will be looking elsewhere for music,1
"I have switched to wynk it's way better than this thrash app. This app is getting worse and worse by each update. 1)This time they removed the customized playlist option, this shows they money hungary nature. 2)You cant choose a song and add it to the playlist. 3) you cant repeat the song again it'll only go forward 4)And this is on top of the long ads and interruptions.",1
Before the the new version this app was best for music. I always felt soothing when I listen music from sportify but now it's getting worse day by day. Please make this app as it was before . I can't tolerate the constant change of songs during playing a playlist. I want to listen the songs that are in my playlist not the recommended songs. I want the old feature back.,1
"New changes have made listening to music painful experience, where you can'nt repeat a song. I used to listen to music only on this app because of its many playlist & almost all the songs were there. I've using this app for more than 2& half year, there new update didn't make anything seems to be useless at this point. I am just disappointed with the latest update. I am going uninstall this app soon. Thankyou",1
"I've moved from Spotify to YouTube Music about a year ago, and I've mostly enjoyed the change. However, this past month, the service has been going downhill. For starters, the new method of liking songs and adding songs to playlists is HORRENDOUS. I don't know why they would change it. Please put the old one back. Secondly, with the new update, lyrics no longer display on songs that have lyrics on some occasions. I guess it's just a bug on the update.",3
"Whoever designed and approved the latest update should be fired! It puts me off from using the app, even though I pay for it. Now it's so hard to find new music based on the recommendations made by the app. The app was not great before, but it was ok the way it was, but now they made it even worse! The user experience just got more cumbersome... Now it has a Tiktok/Instagram look and feel, with album covers taking more space than album titles when in should be the other way around. So so bad!",1
Spotify was one the my favourite and best app for songs. But this new update is just frustrating. You can't listen to the songs you want to. You can't listen to the songs in an order. And there are so many ads all the time. Pls make the next update downgrade the app so that it's better for listening to songs. Now it's like either use premium or don't use the app only.,1
"As much as I remember, Spotify was the best app for music, but after the latest update, it has gone from best to worst. Lyrics are on limited songs, can't play the part of songs we want, etc.... The music still has great quality,but there are too many adds.Spotify has been with me through my worst times. But now it's not as good as before. Please bring it back to normal, I just can't live vithout music....",2
"The worst ever updated. Can't skip song's. Can't play previous song, can't repeat the song, can't play whichever songwe like our playlist, can't play a particular part of the song can't loop or skip the playlist. When your try to do these premium membership . The not end, after each song 3 ads pop up . Like what the hellis the updated all about? I didn't knewthey would go to this extent for getting membership from the listener",1
"Worst experience ever.Spotify was such a great music app. It was the best. But now, it's just gotten worse.Spotify WAS such a great music app. It was the best. But now, it's just gotten worse. One cannot listen specific parts of songs, one cannot repeat a song, cannot add songs to queue, that smart shuffle thing one can't listen a particular playlist/ album it will add other songs, and most of the songs don't show lyrics. Everything is premium. people found this helpful",1
"I would have rated this a 5 star about a year ago, but Spotify is going heavily down hill. If you are listening to a playlist, it will randomly put in other songs that you don't know, you can't skip them because there are too many, and if you run out of skips you are stuck with it. You can play a different playlist but as soon as you go back it's the same. Half the songs aren't even songs I know! I am starting to heavily dislike Spotify and all the new things they have added.",1
"Giving three starts because of a few issues I have. Around half of the tracks disappeared from the my liked songs. This is extremely frustrating. It's also an issue that even though I'm paying for a subscription, Spotify has problems loading my already downloaded music. What's the point then? I am rethinking whether or not I will continue paying.",3
"They like to unhide every song I've ever hidden. All the time. It's tiring. Hiding songs is how I keep track of what playlists I've been through and which ones I haven't. Every time I rate this, they suggest all these fixes and it never helps. I've been having issues with this since the hide feature was first rolled out. Something obviously needs fixed and I'm getting tired of mentioning it.",1
The app keeps freezing. Once I go to Instagram for example to watch a reel the music doesn't resume (even after tapping the play button from the notifications) until I go into the app (which keeps lagging for some reason) to play the song... Most times the songs even start all over from the top. Very disappointing... Quick reinstall?!!... I just updated the app and it's still acting the same way.,2
"I really don't know what has happened to this app, but 2019 spotify was way better than the 2023 spotify. All i see when i open the app is bunch of signals to make me get the premium, and now we can't even listen to a certain part of a music, or can't put it on siffle, or can't replay it. The new algorithm needs to update itself, and just to let you all know we didn't want spotify to look 'funky' we just wanted good quality and peaceful listening. I hope this app gets fixed quickly.",1
"I have usually had a good time using the app, however, as of late audio has cutting out every few seconds. This is extremely annoying and it's been happening since around the later weeks of December, like probably a week before Christmas. I'll have to go a head and pause and un pause, or in some case have to rewind the song I'm listening to. Oh and this only happens if I'm not in the app.",1
"I don't mind paying for a service. I don't even mind adverts if that service is free. The problem with Spotify is that if you don't subscribe to Premium, not only do you get ads, but the service is then completely gimped. Want a particular song? No. You'll have to listen to five others beforehand. Want to skip track? Not so fast hotshot, you've only got a few skips an hour... Not cool especially given the absolute pittance Spotify pays to the artists. Nah, not for me.",1
"The last few updates have been wretched. Why are you changing things that are eorking perfectly? The like ""playlist"", liking songs, the shuffle feature, randomly deciding not to work, the hugely long load times, and the disasterous adding songs to playlists and unliking them, all major issues! I can only like songs from the push-notification, and have to go through a major rigmarole to do so otherwise!",1
"Quality of music is really good, features are also good But, it's not the best music app anymore, especially after the new update. I feel like it's an utter nuisance to not let the user play their desired songs in the order they prefer. If not that, atleast let us play the current song from wherever we like. Even that isn't happening which just sucks. After literally every 3-5 songs there's an advertisement, just sucks I understand that you guys need money to run your app, but this is too much.",3
"Honestly, I've found Spotify Premium to be worth it, but recently I've been having issues. Music will stop in the middle of a song. It doesn't officially pause, the progress of the music just stops and no sound comes out. If I want it to keep playing I have to press pause and then play again, but if it cuts out once, it's very likely to keep doing it. I've seen people reporting similar things, so I know it's probably not just me. Please fix this! I don't wanna pay for a faulty app!",3
"Nah, the app's getting worse with every update. I really wish to get the past Spotify app back, where I could listen to an album or playlist in a sequence, playback any song, skip or repeat any part of song, read lyrics, listen to songs of my choice. The artist I follow, work hard even on the sequence of album. Not being able to listen like that is pathetic. Not everyone owns a Spotify company to afford PREMIUM.",1
"This was my favorite music app and we could even use it without Premium but now you need Spotify Premium for literally everything, for every feature. It doesn't even show the lyrics, You can't even replay a part of a song and some more features are there that shouldn't be a Premium feature and should be available for every user. I hope that the company fixes this problem otherwise there will be no option for me other than, to delete the app. This is too much now. 😠",1
The app really needs to be optimized for offline use. I have to force stop the app 2 or 3 times before I can access my offline episodes or music I've downloaded. It's quite aggravating. Also my remove liked song button is missing when I click the 3 dots next to any song. I know it's missing because I can see it an a different person's phone when they click the same 3 dots. Why would it be different when we have the same phone?,3
"Spotify was my favorite music app...but now it is only a disaster 😩 and it is not useful anymore like before. Now, there is no reply no backward and forward option of a song. Previously I was just change and rewind the song on the lock screen without unlock the phone but now I'm not. And the worst part is about the lyrics I mean what the hell is this there is no lyrics shown on most of the songs. And I'm really obsessed with ads coz that's the reason I download app not for the song right 😒🤬",1
I am really disappointed with the latest update. I copied my playlist from another app to Spotify just a few days ago. After the latest update you have even disabled basic features of the app. You could have stopped playing the music only if you wanted to promote premium that much. Even after playing an ad saying 30 min uninterrupted music. It starts giving ads just after 10 mins. What the !!!,1
"Giving one star because there is no option for zero. Been using Spotify on and off for years and since one of the last updates it's totally broken. Randomly stops. And it's more than annoying. Even if the song was nearly finished it starts from the beginning. Not sure what they've done, but it isn't an improvement, quite the opposite.",1
"After the new update, Spotify literally became one of the worst apps available to mankind! I updated the app to check my wrapped for this year but then I got to know how much worse the app became. Removing the heart/like song button, repeat, replay, skip to any part of the song, the best parts of the apps are gone, and only made for premium users to enjoy, it's really heartbreaking if there was an option for giving 0 stars, I would've given it right away, it's not just me but millions like me.",1
"I pay for Spotify. The app is terribly designed. It does stupid things like skip back to past episodes of podcasts (like months even years back) instead of playing the next chronological unlistened to episode. It freezes all the time. No easy access to the podcast I pay for, it only shows me the free version on home page. Navigating to episode list page on shield app is impossible. Makes me want to cancel. Does not work intuitively.",1
