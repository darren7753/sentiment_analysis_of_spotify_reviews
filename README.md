This project was commissioned by a client on 2024-05-27. If you're interested in similar work, check out my freelance data analyst profile on [Fastwork](https://fastwork.id/user/darren7753).

## Objective
The aim of this project was to assess and improve the client's random forest models for predicting sentiment in Spotify reviews in Indonesian and English, followed by deploying the models with Streamlit.

## App Overview
The app includes two main pages: the Home Page and the Prediction Page.

### Home Page
<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
        <img src="App Screenshots/Screenshot 1.png" width="100%" />
    </td>
    <td align="center">
        <img src="App Screenshots/Screenshot 2.png" width="100%" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

This page introduces the app, provides an overview of Spotify, and details the datasets used to train the sentiment analysis models.

### Prediction Page
<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
        <img src="App Screenshots/Screenshot 3.png" width="100%" />
    </td>
    <td align="center">
        <img src="App Screenshots/Screenshot 4.png" width="100%" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

This page allows users to input text and select a language (Indonesian or English) to predict the sentiment using the trained models.
